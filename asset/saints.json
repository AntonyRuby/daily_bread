        "about": "\n\u00a0\nSaint Ansgar\u2019s Story\nThe \u201capostle of the north\u201d (Scandinavia) had enough frustrations to become a saint\u2014and he did. He became a Benedictine at Corbie, France, where he had been educated. Three years later, when the king of Denmark became a convert, Ansgar went to that country for three years of missionary work, without noticeable success. Sweden asked for Christian missionaries, and he went there, suffering capture by pirates and other hardships on the way. Fewer than two years later, he was recalled, to become abbot of New Corbie (Corvey) and bishop of Hamburg. The pope made him legate for the Scandinavian missions. Funds for the northern apostolate stopped with Emperor Louis\u2019s death. After 13 years\u2019 work in Hamburg, Ansgar saw it burned to the ground by invading Northmen; Sweden and Denmark returned to paganism.\nHe directed new apostolic activities in the North, traveling to Denmark and being instrumental in the conversion of another king. By the strange device of casting lots, the king of Sweden allowed the Christian missionaries to return.\nAnsgar\u2019s biographers remark that he was an extraordinary preacher, a humble and ascetical priest. He was devoted to the poor and the sick, imitating the Lord in washing their feet and waiting on them at table. He died peacefully at Bremen, Germany, without achieving his wish to be a martyr.\nSweden became pagan again after his death, and remained so until the coming of missionaries two centuries later.\nReflection\nHistory records what people do, rather than what they are. Yet the courage and perseverance of men and women like Ansgar can only come from a solid base of union with the original courageous and persevering Missionary. Ansgar\u2019s life is another reminder that God writes straight with crooked lines. Christ takes care of the effects of the apostolate in his own way; he is first concerned about the purity of the apostles themselves.\nSaint Ansgar is the Patron Saint of:\nDenmark\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Presentation of the Lord\nAt the end of the fourth century, a woman named Etheria made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Her journal, discovered in 1887, gives an unprecedented glimpse of liturgical life there. Among the celebrations she describes is the Epiphany, the observance of Christ\u2019s birth, and the gala procession in honor of his Presentation in the Temple 40 days later. Under the Mosaic Law, a woman was ritually \u201cunclean\u201d for 40 days after childbirth, when she was to present herself to the priests and offer sacrifice\u2014her \u201cpurification.\u201d Contact with anyone who had brushed against mystery\u2014birth or death\u2014excluded a person from Jewish worship. This feast emphasizes Jesus\u2019 first appearance in the Temple more than Mary\u2019s purification.\nThe observance spread throughout the Western Church in the fifth and sixth centuries. Because the Church in the West celebrated Jesus\u2019 birth on December 25, the Presentation was moved to February 2, 40 days after Christmas.\nAt the beginning of the eighth century, Pope Sergius inaugurated a candlelight procession; at the end of the same century the blessing and distribution of candles which continues to this day became part of the celebration, giving the feast its popular name: Candlemas.\nReflection\nIn Luke\u2019s account, Jesus was welcomed in the temple by two elderly people, Simeon and the widow Anna. They embody Israel in their patient expectation; they acknowledge the infant Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. Early references to the Roman feast dub it the feast of Saint\u00a0Simeon, the old man who burst into a song of joy which the Church still sings at day\u2019s end.\n\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Blaise\u2019s Story\nWe know more about the devotion to Saint\u00a0Blaise by Christians around the world than we know about the saint himself. His feast is observed as a holy day in some Eastern Churches. In 1222, the Council of Oxford prohibited servile labor in England on Blaise\u2019s feast day. The Germans and Slavs hold him in special honor, and for decades many United States Catholics have sought the annual\u00a0Saint\u00a0Blaise blessing for their throats.\nWe know that Bishop Blaise was martyred in his episcopal city of Sebastea, Armenia, in 316. The legendary Acts of St. Blaise were written 400 years later. According to them Blaise was a good bishop, working hard to encourage the spiritual and physical health of his people. Although the Edict of Toleration (311), granting freedom of worship in the Roman Empire, was already five years old, persecution still raged in Armenia. Blaise was apparently forced to flee to the back country. There he lived as a hermit in solitude and prayer, but he made friends with the wild animals. One day a group of hunters seeking wild animals for the amphitheater stumbled upon Blaise\u2019s cave. They were first surprised and then frightened. The bishop was kneeling in prayer surrounded by patiently waiting wolves, lions and bears.\nThe legend has it that as the hunters hauled Blaise off to prison, a mother came with her young son who had a fish bone lodged in his throat. At Blaise\u2019s command the child was able to cough up the bone.\nAgricolaus, governor of Cappadocia, tried to persuade Blaise to sacrifice to pagan idols. The first time Blaise refused, he was beaten. The next time he was suspended from a tree and his flesh torn with iron combs or rakes. Finally, he was beheaded.\nReflection\nFour centuries give ample opportunity for fiction to creep in with fact. Who can be sure how accurate Blaise\u2019s biographer was? But biographical details are not essential. Blaise is seen as one more example of the power those have who give themselves entirely to Jesus. As Jesus told his apostles at the Last Supper, \u201cIf you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you\u201d (John 15:7). With faith we can follow the lead of the Church in asking for Blaise\u2019s protection.\nSaint Blaise is the Patron Saint of:\nThroat Ailments\nEnglish Wool Combers\n",

Avoiding the safe compromises by which people sometimes undercut the gospel, Joseph denied himself hearty meals and comfortable quarters as he prepared for ordination and a life of preaching.\nIn 1587, he went to Constantinople to take care of the Christian galley slaves working under Turkish masters. Imprisoned for this work, he was warned not to resume it on his release. He did and was again imprisoned and then condemned to death. Miraculously freed, he returned to Italy where he preached to the poor and reconciled feuding families as well as warring cities which had been at odds for years.

Three and a half centuries before, 26 martyrs of Japan were crucified on a hill, now known as the Holy Mountain, overlooking Nagasaki. Among them were priests, brothers, and laymen, Franciscans, Jesuits, and members of the Secular Franciscan Order; there were catechists, doctors, simple artisans, and servants, old men and innocent children\u2014all united in a common faith and love for Jesus and his Church.\nBrother Paul Miki, a Jesuit and a native of Japan, has become the best known among the martyrs of Japan. While hanging upon a cross, Paul Miki preached to the people gathered for the execution: \u201cThe sentence of judgment says these men came to Japan from the Philippines, but I did not come from any other country. I am a true Japanese. The only reason for my being killed is that I have taught the doctrine of Christ. I certainly did teach the doctrine of Christ. I thank God it is for this reason I die. I believe that I am telling only the truth before I die. I know you believe me and I want to say to you all once again: Ask Christ to help you to become happy. I obey Christ. After Christ\u2019s example I forgive my persecutors. I do not hate them. I ask God to have pity on all, and I hope my blood will fall on my fellow men as a fruitful rain.\u201d\nWhen missionaries returned to Japan in the 1860s, at first they found no trace of Christianity. But after establishing themselves they found that thousands of Christians lived around Nagasaki and that they had secretly preserved the faith. Beatified in 1627, the martyrs of Japan were finally canonized in 1862.\nReflection\nToday, a new era has come for the Church in Japan. Although the number of Catholics is not large, the Church is respected and has total religious freedom. The spread of Christianity in the Far East is slow and difficult. Faith such as that of the 26 martyrs is needed today as much as in 1597.\n",

She was resold several times, finally in 1883 to Callisto Legnani, Italian consul in Khartoum, Sudan.\nTwo years later, he took Josephine to Italy and gave her to his friend Augusto Michieli. Bakhita became babysitter to Mimmina Michieli, whom she accompanied to Venice\u2019s Institute of the Catechumens, run by the Canossian Sisters. While Mimmina was being instructed, Josephine felt drawn to the Catholic Church. She was baptized and confirmed in 1890, taking the name Josephine.\nWhen the Michielis returned from Africa and wanted to take Mimmina and Josephine back with them, the future saint refused to go. During the ensuing court case, the Canossian Sisters and the patriarch of Venice intervened on Josephine\u2019s behalf. The judge concluded that since slavery was illegal in Italy, she had actually been free since 1885.\nJosephine entered the Institute of St. Magdalene of Canossa in 1893 and made her profession three years later. In 1902, she was transferred to the city of Schio (northeast of Verona), where she assisted her religious community through cooking, sewing, embroidery, and welcoming visitors at the door.

She founded a religious community for women near Monte Cassino at Plombariola, five miles from where her brother governed a monastery.\nThe twins visited each other once a year in a farmhouse because Scholastica was not permitted inside the monastery. They spent these times discussing spiritual matters.\nAccording to the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, the brother and sister spent their last day together in prayer and conversation. Scholastica sensed her death was close at hand and she begged Benedict to stay with her until the next day.\nHe refused her request because he did not want to spend a night outside the monastery, thus breaking his own Rule. Scholastica asked God to let her brother remain and a severe thunderstorm broke out, preventing Benedict and his monks from returning to the abbey.\nBenedict cried out, \u201cGod forgive you, Sister.

A little more than three years later, on February 11, 1858, a young lady appeared to Bernadette Soubirous. This began a series of visions. During the apparition on March 25, the lady identified herself with the words: \u201cI am the Immaculate Conception.\u201d\nBernadette was a sickly child of poor parents. Their practice of the Catholic faith was scarcely more than lukewarm. Bernadette could pray the Our Father, the Hail Mary and the Creed. She also knew the prayer of the Miraculous Medal: \u201cO Mary conceived without sin.\u201d\nDuring interrogations Bernadette gave an account of what she saw. It was \u201csomething white in the shape of a girl.\u201d She used the word aquero, a dialect term meaning \u201cthis thing.\u201d It was \u201ca pretty young girl with a rosary over her arm.\u201d Her white robe was encircled by a blue girdle. She wore a white veil. There was a yellow rose on each foot. A rosary was in her hand. Bernadette was also impressed by the fact that the lady did not use the informal form of address (tu), but the polite form (vous). The humble virgin appeared to a humble girl and treated her with dignity.\nThrough that humble girl, Mary revitalized and continues to revitalize the faith of millions of people. People began to flock to Lourdes from other parts of France and from all over the world. In 1862 Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions and authorized the cult of Our Lady of Lourdes for the diocese. The Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes became worldwide in 1907.\nReflection\nLourdes has become a place of pilgrimage and healing, but even more of faith. Church authorities have recognized over 60 miraculous cures, although there have probably been many more. To people of faith this is not surprising. It is a continuation of Jesus\u2019 healing miracles\u2014now performed at the intercession of his mother. Some would say that the greater miracles are hidden. Many who visit Lourdes return home with renewed faith and a readiness to serve God in their needy brothers and sisters.\nThere still may be people who doubt the apparitions of Lourdes. Perhaps the best that can be said to them are the words that introduce the film The Song of Bernadette: \u201cFor those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary.

The second person who refused to worship their false idols was a Christian woman named Quinta. Her words infuriated the mob and she was scourged and stoned.\nWhile most of the Christians were fleeing the city, abandoning all their worldly possessions, an old deaconess, Apollonia, was seized. The crowds beat her, knocking out all of her teeth. Then they lit a large fire and threatened to throw her in it if she did not curse her God. She begged them to wait a moment, acting as if she was considering their requests. Instead, she jumped willingly into the flames and so suffered martyrdom.\nThere were many churches and altars dedicated to her. Apollonia is the patroness of dentists, and people suffering from toothache and other dental diseases often ask her intercession. She is pictured with a pair of pincers holding a tooth or with a golden tooth suspended from her necklace. Saint\u00a0Augustine explained her voluntary martyrdom as a special inspiration of the Holy Spirit, since no one is allowed to cause his or her own death.\nReflection\nThe Church has quite a sense of humor! Apollonia is honored as the patron saint of dentists, but this woman who had her teeth extracted without anesthetic surely ought to be the patron of those who dread the chair.

His father\u2019s death left the 18-year-old Francesco to care for the family. Having secured their future, he entered the Friars Minor at Galatone in 1754. For 53 years, he served at St. Paschal\u2019s Hospice in Naples in various roles, such as cook, porter, or most often as official beggar for that community.\n\u201cLove God, love God\u201d was his characteristic phrase as he gathered food for the friars and shared some of his bounty with the poor\u2014all the while consoling the troubled and urging everyone to repent. The charity which he reflected on the streets of Naples was born in prayer and nurtured in the common life of the friars. The people whom Giles met on his begging rounds nicknamed him the \u201cConsoler of Naples.\u201d He was canonized in 1996.\nReflection\nPeople often become arrogant and power hungry when they forget their own sinfulness and ignore the gifts God has given to other people. Giles had a healthy sense of his own sinfulness\u2014not paralyzing but not superficial either. He invited men and women to recognize their own gifts and to live out their dignity as people made in God\u2019s divine image. Knowing someone like Giles can help us on our own spiritual journey.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaints Cyril and Methodius\u2019 Story\nBecause their father was an officer in a part of Greece inhabited by many Slavs, these two Greek brothers ultimately became missionaries, teachers, and patrons of the Slavic peoples.\nAfter a brilliant course of studies, Cyril (called Constantine until he became a monk shortly before his death) refused the governorship of a district such as his brother had accepted among the Slavic-speaking population. Cyril withdrew to a monastery where his brother Methodius had become a monk after some years in a governmental post.\nA decisive change in their lives occurred when the Duke of Moravia asked the Eastern Emperor Michael for political independence from German rule and ecclesiastical autonomy (having their own clergy and liturgy). Cyril and Methodius undertook the missionary task.\nCyril\u2019s first work was to invent an alphabet, still used in some Eastern liturgies. His followers probably formed the Cyrillic alphabet. Together they translated the Gospels, the psalter, Paul\u2019s letters and the liturgical books into Slavonic, and composed a Slavonic liturgy, highly irregular then.\nThat and their free use of the vernacular in preaching led to opposition from the German clergy. The bishop refused to consecrate Slavic bishops and priests, and Cyril was forced to appeal to Rome. On the visit to Rome, he and Methodius had the joy of seeing their new liturgy approved by Pope Adrian II. Cyril, long an invalid, died in Rome 50 days after taking the monastic habit.\nMethodius continued mission work for 16 more years. He was papal legate for all the Slavic peoples, consecrated a bishop and then given an ancient see (now in the Czech Republic). When much of their former territory was removed from their jurisdiction, the Bavarian bishops retaliated with a violent storm of accusation against Methodius. As a result, Emperor Louis the German exiled Methodius for three years. Pope John VIII secured his release.\nBecause the Frankish clergy, still smarting, continued their accusations, Methodius had to go to Rome to defend himself against charges of heresy and uphold his use of the Slavonic liturgy. He was again vindicated.\nLegend has it that in a feverish period of activity, Methodius translated the whole Bible into Slavonic in eight months. He died on Tuesday of Holy Week, surrounded by his disciples, in his cathedral church.\nOpposition continued after his death, and the work of the brothers in Moravia was brought to an end and their disciples scattered. But the expulsions had the beneficial effect of spreading the spiritual, liturgical, and cultural work of the brothers to Bulgaria, Bohemia and southern Poland. Patrons of Moravia, and specially venerated by Catholic Czechs, Slovaks, Croatians, Orthodox Serbians and Bulgarians, Cyril and Methodius are eminently fitted to guard the long-desired unity of East and West. In 1980, Pope John Paul II named them additional co-patrons of Europe (with Benedict).\nReflection\nHoliness means reacting to human life with God\u2019s love: human life as it is, crisscrossed with the political and the cultural, the beautiful and the ugly, the selfish and the saintly. For Cyril and Methodius much of their daily cross had to do with the language of the liturgy. They are not saints because they got the liturgy into Slavonic, but because they did so with the courage and humility of Christ.\nSaints Cyril and Methodius are the Patron Saints of:\nSlavic Peoples\nEcumenism\n",

Sent to France for his higher education, he decided to pursue seminary studies.\nHe returned to England not yet ordained a priest, and inherited several estates from his father. But Gilbert avoided the easy life he could have led under the circumstances. Instead he lived a simple life at a parish, sharing as much as possible with the poor. Following his ordination to the priesthood he served as parish priest at Sempringham.\nAmong the congregation were seven young women who had expressed to him their desire to live in religious life. In response, Gilbert had a house built for them adjacent to the Church. There they lived an austere life, but one which attracted ever more numbers; eventually lay sisters and lay brothers were added to work the land. The religious order formed eventually became known as the Gilbertines, though Gilbert had hoped the Cistercians or some other existing order would take on the responsibility of establishing a rule of life for the new order. The Gilbertines, the only religious order of English origin founded during the Middle Ages, continued to thrive. But the order came to an end when King Henry VIII suppressed all Catholic monasteries.\nOver the years a special custom grew up in the houses of the order called \u201cthe plate of the Lord Jesus.\u201d The best portions of the dinner were put on a special plate and shared with the poor, reflecting Gilbert\u2019s lifelong concern for less fortunate people.\nThroughout his life, Gilbert lived simply, consumed little food, and spent a good portion of many nights in prayer. Despite the rigors of such a life he died at well over age 100.\nReflection\nWhen he came into his father\u2019s wealth, Gilbert could have lived a life of luxury, as many of his fellow priests did at the time. Instead, he chose to share his wealth with the poor. The charming habit of filling \u201cthe plate of the Lord Jesus\u201d in the monasteries he established reflected his concern. Today\u2019s Operation Rice Bowl echoes that habit: eating a simpler meal and letting the difference in the grocery bill help feed the hungry.\n",

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nThe Story of the Seven Founders of the Servite Order\nCan you imagine seven prominent men of Boston or Denver banding together, leaving their homes and professions, and going into solitude for a life directly given to God? That is what happened in the cultured and prosperous city of Florence in the middle of the 13th century. The city was torn with political strife as well as the heresy of the Cathari, who believed that physical reality was inherently evil. Morals were low and religion seemed meaningless.\nIn 1240, seven noblemen of Florence mutually decided to withdraw from the city to a solitary place for prayer and direct service of God. Their initial difficulty was providing for their dependents, since two were still married and two were widowers.\nTheir aim was to lead a life of penance and prayer, but they soon found themselves disturbed by constant visitors from Florence. They next withdrew to the deserted slopes of Monte Senario.\nIn 1244, under the direction of Saint Peter of Verona, O.P., this small group adopted a religious habit similar to the Dominican habit, choosing to live under the Rule of St. Augustine and adopting the name of the Servants of Mary. The new Order took a form more like that of the mendicant friars than that of the older monastic Orders.\nMembers of the community came to the United States from Austria in 1852 and settled in New York and later in Philadelphia. The two American provinces developed from the foundation made by Father Austin Morini in 1870 in Wisconsin.\nCommunity members combined monastic life and active ministry. In the monastery, they led a life of prayer, work and silence while in the active apostolate they engaged in parochial work, teaching, preaching, and other ministerial activities.\nReflection\nThe time in which the seven Servite founders lived is very easily comparable to the situation in which we find ourselves today. It is \u201cthe best of times and the worst of times,\u201d as Dickens once wrote. Some, perhaps many, feel called to a countercultural life, even in religion. All of us are faced in a new and urgent way with the challenge to make our lives decisively centered in Christ.\n\u00a0\n",

He eventually came to be known as Fra Angelico, perhaps a tribute to his own angelic qualities or maybe the devotional tone of his works.\nHe continued to study painting and perfect his own techniques, which included broad-brush strokes, vivid colors and generous, lifelike figures. Michelangelo once said of Fra Angelico: \u201cOne has to believe that this good monk has visited paradise and been allowed to choose his models there.\u201d Whatever his subject matter, Fra Angelico sought to generate feelings of religious devotion in response to his paintings. Among his most famous works are the Annunciation and Descent from the Cross as well as frescoes in the monastery of San Marco in Florence.\nHe also served in leadership positions within the Dominican Order. At one point, Pope Eugenius approached him about serving as archbishop of Florence. Fra Angelico declined, preferring a simpler life. He died in 1455.\nReflection\nThe work of artists adds a wonderful dimension to life. Without art our lives would be much depleted.

Conrad confessed his guilt, saved the man\u2019s life, and paid for the damaged property.\nSoon after this event, Conrad and his wife agreed to separate: she to a Poor Clare monastery and he to a group of hermits following the Third Order Rule.

Since his many visitors destroyed his solitude, Conrad went to a more remote spot in Sicily where he lived 36 years as a hermit, praying for himself and for the rest of the world.\nPrayer and penance were his answer to the temptations that beset him.

At that time, Europe was involved in an extremely bloody war. Portugal itself was in political turmoil, having overthrown its monarchy in 1910; the government disbanded religious organizations soon after.\nAt the first appearance, Mary asked the children to return to that spot on the thirteenth of each month for the next six months. She also asked them to learn to read and write and to pray the rosary \u201cto obtain peace for the world and the end of the war.\u201d They were to pray for sinners and for the conversion of Russia, which had recently overthrown Czar Nicholas II and was soon to fall under communism. Up to 90,000 people gathered for Mary\u2019s final apparition on October 13, 1917.\nLess than two years later, Francisco died of influenza in his family home. He was buried in the parish cemetery and then re-buried in the F\u00e1tima basilica in 1952. Jacinta died of influenza in Lisbon in 1920, offering her suffering for the conversion of sinners, peace in the world, and the Holy Father. She was re-buried in the F\u00e1tima basilica in 1951. Their cousin L\u00facia dos Santos, became a Carmelite nun and was still living when Jacinta and Francisco were beatified in 2000; she died five years later. Pope Francis canonized the younger children on his visit to F\u00e1tima to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first apparition\u2013May 13, 2017. The shrine of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima is visited by up to 20 million people a year.\nReflection\nThe Church is always very cautious about endorsing alleged apparitions, but it has seen benefits from people changing their lives because of the message of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima.

It was the ordinary thing for him to have a poor person or two with him at table and he liked to minister personally to their needs.\nPeter escaped poverty and the neglect of his own brother when his other brother, who was archpriest of Ravenna, took him under his wing. His brother sent him to good schools and Peter became a professor.\nAlready in those days, Peter was very strict with himself. He wore a hair shirt under his clothes, fasted rigorously and spent many hours in prayer. Soon, he decided to leave his teaching and give himself completely to prayer with the Benedictines of the reform of Saint Romuald at Fonte Avellana. They lived two monks to a hermitage. Peter was so eager to pray and slept so little that he soon suffered from severe insomnia. He found he had to use some prudence in taking care of himself. When he was not praying, he studied the Bible.\nThe abbot commanded that when he died Peter should succeed him. Abbot Peter founded five other hermitages. He encouraged his brothers in a life of prayer and solitude and wanted nothing more for himself. The Holy See periodically called on him, however, to be a peacemaker or troubleshooter, between two abbeys in dispute or a cleric or government official in some disagreement with Rome.\nFinally, Pope Stephen IX made Peter the cardinal-bishop of Ostia. He worked hard to wipe out simony\u2014the buying of church offices\u2013and encouraged his priests to observe celibacy and urged even the diocesan clergy to live together and maintain scheduled prayer and religious observance. He wished to restore primitive discipline among religious and priests, warning against needless travel, violations of poverty, and too comfortable living. He even wrote to the bishop of Besancon complaining that the canons there sat down when they were singing the psalms in the Divine Office.\nHe wrote many letters. Some 170 are extant. We also have 53 of his sermons and seven lives, or biographies, that he wrote. He preferred examples and stories rather than theory in his writings. The liturgical offices he wrote are evidence of his talent as a stylist in Latin.\nHe asked often to be allowed to retire as cardinal-bishop of Ostia, and finally Pope Alexander II consented. Peter was happy to become once again just a monk, but he was still called to serve as a papal legate. When returning from such an assignment in Ravenna, he was overcome by a fever. With the monks gathered around him saying the Divine Office, he died on February 22, 1072.\nIn 1828, he was declared a Doctor of the Church.\nReflection\nPeter was a reformer and if he were alive today would no doubt encourage the renewal started by Vatican II. He would also applaud the greater emphasis on prayer that is shown by the growing number of priests, religious, and laypersons who gather regularly for prayer, as well as the special houses of prayer recently established by many religious communities.\n",

Angels at the tomb say to Magdalene, \u201cThe Lord has risen! Go, tell his disciples and Peter.\u201d John relates that when he and Peter ran to the tomb, the younger outraced the older, then waited for him. Peter entered, saw the wrappings on the ground, the headpiece rolled up in a place by itself. John saw and believed. But he adds a reminder: \u201c\u2026[T]hey did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead\u201d (John 20:9). They went home. There the slowly exploding, impossible idea became reality. Jesus appeared to them as they waited fearfully behind locked doors. \u201cPeace be with you,\u201d he said (John 20:21b), and they rejoiced.\nThe Pentecost event completed Peter\u2019s experience of the risen Christ. \u201c\u2026[T]hey were all filled with the holy Spirit\u201d (Acts 2:4a) and began to express themselves in foreign tongues and make bold proclamation as the Spirit prompted them.\nOnly then can Peter fulfill the task Jesus had given him: \u201c\u2026 [O]nce you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers\u201d (Luke 22:32). He at once becomes the spokesman for the Twelve about their experience of the Holy Spirit\u2014before the civil authorities who wished to quash their preaching, before the Council of Jerusalem, for the community in the problem of Ananias and Sapphira. He is the first to preach the Good News to the Gentiles. The healing power of Jesus in him is well attested: the raising of Tabitha from the dead, the cure of the crippled beggar. People carry the sick into the streets so that when Peter passed his shadow might fall on them.\nEven a saint experiences difficulty in Christian living. When Peter stopped eating with Gentile converts because he did not want to wound the sensibilities of Jewish Christians, Paul says, \u201c\u2026I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong\u2026. [T]hey were not on the right road in line with the truth of the gospel\u2026\u201d (Galatians 2:11b, 14a).\nAt the end of John\u2019s Gospel, Jesus says to Peter, \u201cAmen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go\u201d (John 21:18). What Jesus said indicated the sort of death by which Peter was to glorify God. On Vatican Hill, in Rome, during the reign of Nero, Peter did glorify his Lord with a martyr\u2019s death, probably in the company of many Christians.\nSecond-century Christians built a small memorial over his burial spot. In the fourth century, the Emperor Constantine built a basilica, which was replaced in the 16th century.\nReflection\nLike the committee chair, this chair refers to the occupant, not the furniture. Its first occupant stumbled a bit, denying Jesus three times and hesitating to welcome gentiles into the new Church. Some of its later occupants have also stumbled a bit, sometimes even failed scandalously. As individuals, we may sometimes think a particular pope has let us down. Still, the office endures as a sign of the long tradition we cherish and as a focus for the universal Church.\n",

The Asia Minor Churches recognized Polycarp\u2019s leadership by choosing him as a representative to discuss with Pope Anicetus the date of the Easter celebration in Rome\u2014a major controversy in the early Church.\nOnly one of the many letters written by Polycarp has been preserved, the one he wrote to the Church of Philippi in Macedonia.\nAt 86, Polycarp was led into the crowded Smyrna stadium to be burned alive.

        "about": "\u00a0\nBlessed Luke Belludi\u2019s Story\nIn 1220, Saint\u00a0Anthony was preaching conversion to the inhabitants of Padua when a young nobleman, Luke Belludi, came up to him and humbly asked to receive the habit of the followers of Saint\u00a0Francis. Anthony liked the talented, well-educated Luke and personally recommended him to Francis, who then received him into the Franciscan Order.\nLuke, then only 20, was to be Anthony\u2019s companion in his travels and in his preaching, tending to him in his last days and taking Anthony\u2019s place upon his death. He was appointed guardian of the Friars Minor in the city of Padua. In 1239, the city fell into the hands of its enemies. Nobles were put to death, the mayor and council were banished, the great university of Padua gradually closed and the church dedicated to Saint\u00a0Anthony was left unfinished. Luke himself was expelled from the city but secretly returned.\nAt night he and the new guardian would visit the tomb of Saint\u00a0Anthony in the unfinished shrine to pray for his help. One night a voice came from the tomb assuring them that the city would soon be delivered from its evil tyrant.\nAfter the fulfillment of the prophetic message, Luke was elected provincial minister and furthered the completion of the great basilica in honor of Anthony, his teacher. He founded many convents of the order and had, as Anthony, the gift of miracles. Upon his death he was laid to rest in the basilica that he had helped finish and has had a continual veneration up to the present time.\nReflection\nThe epistles refer several times to a man named Luke as Paul\u2019s trusted companion on his missionary journeys. Perhaps every great preacher needs a Luke; Anthony surely did. Luke Belludi not only accompanied Anthony on his travels, he also cared for the great saint in his final illness and carried on Anthony\u2019s mission after the saint\u2019s death. Yes, every preacher needs a Luke, someone to offer support and reassurance\u2014including those who minister to us. We don\u2019t even have to change our names!\n\u00a0",

At the age of 31, he sailed to Mexico, where he began working in the fields. Eventually he built roads to facilitate agricultural trading and other commerce. His 466-mile road from Mexico City to Zacatecas took 10 years to build and required careful negotiations with the indigenous peoples along the way.\nIn time Sebastian was a wealthy farmer and rancher. At the age of 60, he entered a virginal marriage. His wife\u2019s motivation may have been a large inheritance; his was to provide a respectable life for a girl without even a modest marriage dowry. When his first wife died, he entered another virginal marriage for the same reason; his second wife also died young.\nAt the age of 72, Sebastian distributed his goods among the poor and entered the Franciscans as a brother. Assigned to the large (100-member) friary at Puebla de los Angeles south of Mexico City, Sebastian went out collecting alms for the friars for the next 25 years. His charity to all earned him the nickname \u201cAngel of Mexico.\u201d\nSebastian was beatified in 1787 and is known as a patron of travelers.\nReflection\nAccording to the Rule of Saint Francis, the friars were to work for their daily bread. Sometimes, however, their work would not provide for their needs; for example, working with people suffering from leprosy brought little or no pay. In cases such as these, the friars were allowed to beg, always keeping in mind the admonition of Francis to let their good example commend them to the people.

He was educated by the Jesuits and, having been cured twice of serious illnesses, came to believe that God was calling him to the religious life. Young Francis wished to join the Jesuits but was turned down, probably because of his age, not yet 17. Following the death of a sister to cholera, his resolve to enter religious life became even stronger and he was accepted by the Passionists. Upon entering the novitiate he was given the name Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows.\nEver popular and cheerful, Gabriel quickly was successful in his effort to be faithful in little things.

Ever obedient, he patiently bore the painful effects of the disease and the restrictions it required, seeking no special notice. He died peacefully on February 27, 1862, at age 24, having been an example to both young and old.\nSaint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows was canonized in 1920.\nReflection\nWhen we think of achieving great holiness by doing little things with love and grace, Therese of Lisieux comes first to mind.

He combined the Christian religion with the best elements in Greek philosophy. In his view, philosophy was a pedagogue of Christ, an educator that was to lead one to Christ.\nJustin is known as an apologist, one who defends in writing the Christian religion against the attacks and misunderstandings of the pagans. Two of his so-called apologies have come down to us; they are addressed to the Roman emperor and to the Senate.\nFor his staunch adherence to the Christian religion, Justin was beheaded in Rome in 165.\nReflection\nAs patron of philosophers, Justin may inspire us to use our natural powers\u2014especially our power to know and understand\u2014in the service of Christ, and to build up the Christian life within us. Since we are prone to error, especially in reference to the deep questions concerning life and existence, we should also be willing to correct and check our natural thinking in light of religious truth.

Two characteristics stand out: his Christian orthodoxy and his fidelity to the pope of Rome.\nHow absolutely necessary this orthodoxy and fidelity were is borne out by the conditions Boniface found on his first missionary journey in 719 at the request of Pope Gregory II. Paganism was a way of life. What Christianity he did find had either lapsed into paganism or was mixed with error. The clergy were mainly responsible for these latter conditions since they were in many instances uneducated, lax and questionably obedient to their bishops. In particular instances their very ordinations were questionable.\nThese are the conditions that Boniface was to report in 722 on his first return visit to Rome. The Holy Father instructed him to reform the German Church. The pope sent letters of recommendation to religious and civil leaders. Boniface later admitted that his work would have been unsuccessful, from a human viewpoint, without a letter of safe-conduct from Charles Martel, the powerful Frankish ruler, grandfather of Charlemagne. Boniface was finally made a regional bishop and authorized to organize the whole German Church. He was eminently successful.\nIn the Frankish kingdom, he met great problems because of lay interference in bishops\u2019 elections, the worldliness of the clergy and lack of papal control.\nDuring a final mission to the Frisians, Boniface and 53 companions were massacred while he was preparing converts for confirmation.\nIn order to restore the Germanic Church to its fidelity to Rome and to convert the pagans, Boniface had been guided by two principles. The first was to restore the obedience of the clergy to their bishops in union with the pope of Rome. The second was the establishment of many houses of prayer which took the form of Benedictine monasteries. A great number of Anglo-Saxon monks and nuns followed him to the continent, where he introduced the Benedictine nuns to the active apostolate of education.\nReflection\nBoniface bears out the Christian rule: To follow Christ is to follow the way of the cross. For Boniface, it was not only physical suffering or death, but the painful, thankless, bewildering task of Church reform. Missionary glory is often thought of in terms of bringing new persons to Christ. It seems\u2014but is not\u2014less glorious to heal the household of the faith.\nSaint Boniface is the Patron Saint of:\nGermany\n",

Even with the aid of a goodly number of men who joined his Order, he realized that nothing could be effectively done without God\u2019s power. Finding this help especially in devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, he and his Norbertines praised God for success in converting heretics, reconciling numerous enemies, and rebuilding faith in indifferent believers. Many of them lived in central houses during the week and served in parishes on weekends.\nReluctantly, Norbert became archbishop of Magdeburg in central Germany, a territory half pagan and half Christian. In this position he zealously and courageously continued his work for the Church until his death on June 6, 1134.\nReflection\nA different world cannot be built by indifferent people. The same is true in regard to the Church. The indifference of vast numbers of nominal faithful to ecclesiastical authority and essential doctrines of the faith weakens the Church\u2019s witness.

In 1940, Franz was called up again but allowed to return home at the request of the town\u2019s mayor. He was in active service between October 1940 and April 1941, but was again deferred.

I do not judge anyone. I can only judge myself.\u201d He continued, \u201cI have considered my family. I have prayed and put myself and my family in God\u2019s hands. I know that, if I do what I think God wants me to do, he will take care of my family.\u201d\nOn August 8, 1943, Franz wrote to Fransizka: \u201cDear wife and mother, I thank you once more from my heart for everything that you have done for me in my lifetime, for all the sacrifices that you have borne for me. I beg you to forgive me if I have hurt or offended you, just as I have forgiven everything\u2026My heartfelt greetings for my dear children. I will surely beg the dear God, if I am permitted to enter heaven soon, that he will set aside a little place in heaven for all of you.\u201d\nFranz was beheaded and cremated the following day. In 1946, his ashes were reburied in St. Radegund near a memorial inscribed with his name and the names of almost 60 village men who died during their military service. He was beatified in Linz on October 26, 2007. His \u201cspiritual testament\u201d is now in Rome\u2019s St. Bartholomew Church as part of a shrine to 20th-century martyrs for their faith.\n",

Those are the headlines from the tragic life of today\u2019s saint.\nBorn into a powerful family in 12th-century England, William seemed destined for great things. His uncle was next in line for the English throne\u2014though a nasty dynastic struggle complicated things. William himself faced an internal Church feud.\nDespite these roadblocks, he was nominated as archbishop of York in 1140. Local clergymen were less enthusiastic, however, and the archbishop of Canterbury refused to consecrate William. Three years later a neighboring bishop performed the consecration, but it lacked the approval of Pope Innocent II, whose successors likewise withheld approval. William was deposed, and a new election was ordered.\nIt was not until 1154\u201414 years after he was first nominated\u2014that William became archbishop of York. When he entered the city that spring after years of exile, he received an enthusiastic welcome. Within two months he was dead, probably from poisoning. His administrative assistant was a suspect, though no formal ruling was ever made.\nDespite all that happened to him, William did not show resentment toward his opponents. Following his death, many miracles were attributed to him. He was canonized 73 years later.\nReflection\n\u201cGood things come to those who wait\u201d might be the catch phrase for today\u2019s saint. We don\u2019t always get what we want when we want it.

He took upon himself the special task of opposing the many false doctrines rampant at his time, always remaining a true and forceful defender of the Catholic Church.\nBorn in Nisibis, Mesopotamia, he was baptized as a young man and became famous as a teacher in his native city. When the Christian emperor had to cede Nisibis to the Persians, Ephrem fled as a refugee to Edessa, along with many other Christians. He is credited with attracting great glory to the biblical school there. He was ordained a deacon but declined becoming a priest. Ephrem was said to have avoided presbyteral consecration by feigning madness!\nHe had a prolific pen, and his writings best illumine his holiness. Although he was not a man of great scholarship, his works reflect deep insight and knowledge of the Scriptures. In writing about the mysteries of humanity\u2019s redemption, Ephrem reveals a realistic and humanly sympathetic spirit and a great devotion to the humanity of Jesus. It is said that his poetic account of the Last Judgment inspired Dante.\nIt is surprising to read that he wrote hymns against the heretics of his day. He would take the popular songs of the heretical groups and using their melodies, compose beautiful hymns embodying orthodox doctrine. Ephrem became one of the first to introduce song into the Church\u2019s public worship as a means of instruction for the faithful. His many hymns have earned him the title \u201cHarp of the Holy Spirit.\u201d\nEphrem preferred a simple, austere life, living in a small cave overlooking the city of Edessa. It was here that he died around 373.\nReflection\nMany Catholics still find singing in church a problem, probably because of the rather individualistic piety that they inherited. Yet singing has been a tradition of both the Old and the New Testaments. It is an excellent way of expressing and creating a community spirit of unity as well as of joy. An ancient historian testifies that Ephrem\u2019s hymns \u201clent luster to the Christian assemblies.\u201d We need some modern Ephrems\u2014and cooperating singers\u2014to do the same for our Christian assemblies today.\nAnother Saint of the Day for June 9 is Saint Columba.\n",

But her life took an altogether different turn at 16 with her marriage to a young lawyer, Theodore de Mas. Both deeply devout, they became secular Franciscans. During their 17 years of married life they raised eight children.\nThe normalcy of their family life was interrupted when Napoleon invaded Spain. Joachima had to flee with the children; Theodore remained behind and died. Though Joachima re-experienced a desire to enter a religious community, she attended to her duties as a mother. At the same time, the young widow led a life of austerity and chose to wear the habit of the Third Order of St. Francis as her ordinary dress. She spent much time in prayer and visiting the sick.\nFour years later, with some of her children now married and younger ones under their care, Joachima confessed her desire to a priest to join a religious order. With his encouragement, she established the Carmelite Sisters of Charity. In the midst of the fratricidal wars occurring at the time, Joachima was briefly imprisoned and later exiled to France for several years.\nSickness ultimately compelled her to resign as superior of her order. Over the next four years she slowly succumbed to paralysis, which caused her to die by inches. At her death at the age of 71 in 1854, Joachima was known and admired for her high degree of prayer, deep trust in God, and selfless charity. Joachima was beatified by Pope Pius XII\u00a0 in 1940, and canonized by Pope John XXIII in 1959.\nReflection\nJoachima understands loss. She lost the home where her children grew up, her husband, and finally her health. As the power to move and care for her own needs slowly ebbed away, this woman who had all her life cared for others became wholly dependent; she required help with life\u2019s simplest tasks. When our own lives go spinning out of control, when illness and bereavement and financial hardship strike, all we can do is cling to the belief that sustained Joachima: God watches over us always.\n",

He and Paul instructed in Antioch for a year, after which they took relief contributions to Jerusalem.\nLater Paul and Barnabas, now clearly seen as charismatic leaders, were sent by Antioch officials to preach to the gentiles. Enormous success crowned their efforts. After a miracle at Lystra, the people wanted to offer sacrifice to them as gods\u2014Barnabas being Zeus, and Paul, Hermes\u2014but the two said, \u201cWe are of the same nature as you, human beings. We proclaim to you good news that you should turn from these idols to the living God\u201d (see Acts 14:8-18).\nBut all was not peaceful. They were expelled from one town, they had to go to Jerusalem to clear up the ever-recurring controversy about circumcision, and even the best of friends can have differences. When Paul wanted to revisit the places they had evangelized, Barnabas wanted to take along his cousin John Mark, author of the Gospel, but Paul insisted that since Mark had deserted them once, he was not fit to take along now. The disagreement that followed was so sharp that Barnabas and Paul separated: Barnabas taking Mark to Cyprus, Paul taking Silas to Syria. Later they were reconciled\u2014Paul, Barnabas and Mark.\nWhen Paul stood up to Peter for not eating with gentiles for fear of his Jewish friends, we learn that \u201ceven Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy\u201d (see Galatians 2:1-13).\nReflection\nBarnabas is spoken of simply as one who dedicated his life to the Lord.

Every time Anthony responded with renewed zeal and self-sacrificing to serve his Lord Jesus more completely.\nHis journey as the servant of God began as a very young man when he decided to join the Augustinians in Lisbon, giving up a future of wealth and power to be a servant of God. Later when the bodies of the first Franciscan martyrs went through the Portuguese city where he was stationed, he was again filled with an intense longing to be one of those closest to Jesus himself: those who die for the Good News.\nSo Anthony entered the Franciscan Order and set out to preach to the Moors. But an illness prevented him from achieving that goal. He went to Italy and was stationed in a small hermitage where he spent most of his time praying, reading the Scriptures and doing menial tasks.\nThe call of God came again at an ordination where no one was prepared to speak. The humble and obedient Anthony hesitantly accepted the task. The years of searching for Jesus in prayer, of reading sacred Scripture and of serving him in poverty, chastity, and obedience had prepared Anthony to allow the Spirit to use his talents. Anthony\u2019s sermon was astounding to those who expected an unprepared speech and knew not the Spirit\u2019s power to give people words.\nRecognized as a great man of prayer and a great Scripture and theology scholar, Anthony became the first friar to teach theology to the other friars. Soon he was called from that post to preach to the Albigensians in France, using his profound knowledge of Scripture and theology to convert and reassure those who had been misled by their denial of Christ\u2019s divinity and of the sacraments..\nAfter he led the friars in northern Italy for three years, he made his headquarters in the city of Padua. He resumed his preaching and began writing sermon notes to help other preachers. In the spring of 1231 Anthony withdrew to a friary at Camposampiero where he had a sort of treehouse built as a hermitage. There he prayed and prepared for death.\nOn June 13, he became very ill and asked to be taken back to Padua, where he died after receiving the last sacraments. Anthony was canonized less than a year later and named a Doctor of the Church in 1946.\nReflection\nAnthony should be the patron of those who find their lives completely uprooted and set in a new and unexpected direction. Like all saints, he is a perfect example of turning one\u2019s life completely over to Christ. God did with Anthony as God pleased\u2014and what God pleased was a life of spiritual power and brilliance that still attracts admiration today. He whom popular devotion has nominated as finder of lost objects found himself by losing himself totally to the providence of God.\nSaint Anthony of Padua is the Patron Saint of:\nLost items\nPoor\nTravelers\n",

Eight years later she married Fran\u00e7ois d\u2019Youville; they had six children, four of whom died young. Despite the fact that her husband gambled, sold liquor illegally to Native Americans, and treated her indifferently, she cared for him compassionately until his death in 1730.\nEven though she was caring for two small children and running a store to help pay off her husband\u2019s debts, Marguerite still helped the poor. Once her children were grown, she and several companions rescued a Quebec hospital that was in danger of failing. She called her community the Institute of the Sisters of Charity of Montreal; the people called them the \u201cGrey Nuns\u201d because of the color of their habits. In time, a proverb arose among the poor people of Montreal, \u201cGo to the Grey Nuns; they never refuse to serve.\u201d In time, five other religious communities traced their roots to the Grey Nuns.\nThe General Hospital in Montreal became known as the H\u00f4tel Dieu (House of God) and set a standard for medical care and Christian compassion. When the hospital was destroyed by fire in 1766, M\u00e8re Marguerite knelt in the ashes, led the Te Deum\u2014a hymn to God\u2019s providence in all circumstances\u2014and began the rebuilding process.

He did so at age 18. Despite his rigorous academic schedule, he spent many hours in chapel, often to the dismay of fellow seminarians who were concerned about his health. Following his ordination to the priesthood, John Francis undertook missionary work in various French towns. While the formal sermons of the day tended toward the poetic, his discourses were plain. But they revealed the fervor within him and attracted people of all classes. Father Regis especially made himself available to the poor. Many mornings were spent in the confessional or at the altar celebrating Mass; afternoons were reserved for visits to prisons and hospitals.\nThe bishop of Viviers, observing the success of Father Regis in communicating with people, sought to draw on his many gifts, especially needed during the prolonged civil and religious strife then rampant throughout France. With many prelates absent and priests negligent, the people had been deprived of the sacraments for 20 years or more. Various forms of Protestantism were thriving in some cases while a general indifference toward religion was evident in other instances. For three years, Father Regis traveled throughout the diocese, conducting missions in advance of a visit by the bishop. He succeeded in converting many people and in bringing many others back to religious observances.\nThough Father Regis longed to work as a missionary among the Native Americans in Canada, he was to live out his days working for the Lord in the wildest and most desolate part of his native France. There he encountered rigorous winters, snowdrifts and other deprivations. Meanwhile he continued preaching missions and earned a reputation as a saint. Upon entering the town of Saint-And\u00e9, one man came upon a large crowd in front of a church and was told that people were waiting for \u201cthe saint\u201d who was coming to preach a mission.\nThe last four years of his life were spent preaching and organizing social services, especially for prisoners, the sick and the poor. In the autumn of 1640, Father Regis sensed that his days were coming to a conclusion. He settled some of his affairs and prepared for the end by continuing to do what he did so well: speaking to the people about the God who loved them. On December 31, he spent most of the day with his eyes on the crucifix. That evening, he died. His final words were: \u201cInto thy hands I commend my spirit.\u201d\nJohn Francis Regis was canonized in 1737.\nReflection\nJohn longed to travel to the New World and become a missionary to the Native Americans, but he was called instead to work among his own compatriots. Unlike many famous preachers, he isn\u2019t remembered for golden-tongued oratory. What people who listened to him heard was his own fervent faith, and it had a powerful effect on them. We can recall homilists who impressed us for the same reason. More importantly for us, we can also remember ordinary people, neighbors and friends, whose faith and goodness touched us and brought us to deeper faith. That is the calling most of us must follow.\n",

He began to pray as intensely as he used to drink. He also tried to pay back people from whom he had borrowed or stolen money while he was drinking.\nMost of his life Matt worked as a builder\u2019s laborer. He joined the Secular Franciscan Order and began a life of strict penance; he abstained from meat nine months a year. Matt spent hours every night avidly reading Scripture and the lives of the saints. He prayed the rosary conscientiously. Though his job did not make him rich, Matt contributed generously to the missions.\nAfter 1923, his health failed, and Matt was forced to quit work. He died on his way to church on Trinity Sunday. Fifty years later, Pope Paul VI gave him the title venerable. His\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is June 19.\nReflection\nIn looking at the life of Matt Talbot, we may easily focus on the later years when he had stopped drinking for some time and was leading a penitential life. Only alcoholic men and women who have stopped drinking can fully appreciate how difficult the earliest years of sobriety were for Matt.\nHe had to take one day at a time.

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Romuald\u2019s Story\nIn the midst of a wasted youth, Romuald watched his father kill a relative in a duel over property. In horror he fled to a monastery near Ravenna. After three years, some of the monks found him to be uncomfortably holy and eased him out.\nRomuald spent the next 30 years going about Italy, founding monasteries and hermitages. He longed to give his life to Christ in martyrdom, and got the pope\u2019s permission to preach the gospel in Hungary. But he was struck with illness as soon as he arrived, and the illness recurred as often as he tried to proceed.\nDuring another period of his life, Romuald suffered great spiritual dryness. One day as he was praying Psalm 31 (\u201cI will give you understanding and I will instruct you\u201d), he was given an extraordinary light and spirit which never left him.\nAt the next monastery where he stayed, Romuald was accused of a scandalous crime by a young nobleman he had rebuked for a dissolute life. Amazingly, his fellow monks believed the accusation. He was given a severe penance, forbidden from offering Mass, and excommunicated\u2014an unjust sentence that he endured in silence for six months.\nThe most famous of the monasteries Romuald founded was that of the Camaldoli in Tuscany. Here began the Order of the Camaldolese Benedictines, uniting the monastic and eremitical lives. In later life Romuald\u2019s own father became a monk, wavered, and was kept faithful by the encouragement of his son.\nReflection\nChrist is a gentle leader, but he calls us to total holiness. Now and then, men and women are raised up to challenge us by the absoluteness of their dedication, the vigor of their spirit, the depth of their conversion. The fact that we cannot duplicate their lives does not change the call to us to be totally open to God in our own particular circumstances.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Paulinus of Nola\u2019s Story\nAnyone who is praised in the letters of six or seven saints undoubtedly must be of extraordinary character. Such a person was Paulinus of Nola, correspondent and friend of Saints Augustine, Jerome, Melania, Martin, Gregory the Great, and Ambrose.\nBorn near Bordeaux, he was the son of the Roman prefect of Gaul, who had extensive property in both Gaul and Italy. Paulinus became a distinguished lawyer, holding several public offices in the Roman Empire. With his Spanish wife, Therasia, he retired at an early age to a life of cultured leisure.\nThe two were baptized by the saintly bishop of Bordeaux and moved to Therasia\u2019s estate in Spain. After many childless years, they had a son who died a week after birth. This occasioned their beginning a life of great austerity and charity, giving away most of their Spanish property. Possibly as a result of this great example, Paulinus was rather unexpectedly ordained a priest at Christmas by the bishop of Barcelona.\nHe and his wife then moved to Nola, near Naples. He had a great love for Saint\u00a0Felix of Nola, and spent much effort in promoting devotion to this saint. Paulinus gave away most of his remaining property\u2014to the consternation of his relatives\u2014and continued his work for the poor. Supporting a host of debtors, the homeless and other needy people, he lived a monastic life in another part of his home. By popular demand he was made bishop of Nola and guided that diocese for 21 years.\nPaulinus\u2019 last years were saddened by the invasion of the Huns. Among his few writings is the earliest extant Christian wedding song.\u00a0His Liturgical Feast Day is June 22.\nReflection\nMany of us are tempted to \u201cretire\u201d early in life, after an initial burst of energy. Devotion to Christ and his work is waiting to be done all around us. Paulinus\u2019 life had scarcely begun when he thought it was over, as he took his ease on that estate in Spain. \u201cMan proposes, but God disposes.\u201d",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Aloysius Gonzaga\u2019s Story\nThe Lord can make saints anywhere, even amid the brutality and license of Renaissance life. Florence was the \u201cmother of piety\u201d for Aloysius Gonzaga despite his exposure to a \u201csociety of fraud, dagger, poison, and lust.\u201d As a son of a princely family, he grew up in royal courts and army camps. His father wanted Aloysius to be a military hero.\nAt age 7 Aloysius experienced a profound spiritual quickening. His prayers included the Office of Mary, the psalms, and other devotions. At age 9\u00a0he came from his hometown of Castiglione to Florence to be educated; by age 11 he was teaching catechism to poor children, fasting three days a week, and practicing great austerities. When he was 13 years old, he traveled with his parents and the Empress of Austria to Spain, and acted as a page in the court of Philip II. The more Aloysius saw of court life, the more disillusioned he became, seeking relief in learning about the lives of saints.\nA book about the experience of Jesuit missionaries in India suggested to him the idea of entering the Society of Jesus, and in Spain his decision became final. Now began a four-year contest with his father. Eminent churchmen and laypeople were pressed into service to persuade Aloysius to remain in his \u201cnormal\u201d vocation. Finally he prevailed, was allowed to renounce his right to succession, and was received into the Jesuit novitiate.\nLike other seminarians, Aloysius was faced with a new kind of penance\u2014that of accepting different ideas about the exact nature of penance. He was obliged to eat more, and to take recreation with the other students. He was forbidden to pray except at stated times. He spent four years in the study of philosophy and had Saint\u00a0Robert Bellarmine as his spiritual adviser.\nIn 1591, a plague struck Rome. The Jesuits opened a hospital of their own. The superior general himself and many other Jesuits rendered personal service. Because he nursed patients, washing them and making their beds, Aloysius caught the disease. A fever persisted after his recovery and he was so weak he could scarcely rise from bed. Yet, he maintained his great discipline of prayer, knowing that he would die within the octave of Corpus Christi, three months later, at the age of 23.\nReflection\nAs a saint who fasted, scourged himself, sought solitude and prayer, and did not look on the faces of women, Aloysius seems an unlikely patron of youth in a society where asceticism is confined to training camps of football teams and boxers, and sexual permissiveness has little left to permit. Can an overweight and air-conditioned society deprive itself of anything? It will when it discovers a reason, as Aloysius did. The motivation for letting God purify us is the experience of God loving us in prayer.\nSaint Aloysius Gonzaga is the Patron Saint of:\nCatholic Youth\nTeenagers\n\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint John Fisher\u2019s Story\nJohn Fisher is usually associated with Erasmus, Thomas More, and other Renaissance humanists. His life therefore, did not have the external simplicity found in the lives of some saints. Rather, he was a man of learning, associated with the intellectuals and political leaders of his day. He was interested in the contemporary culture and eventually became chancellor at Cambridge. He had been made a bishop at 35, and one of his interests was raising the standard of preaching in England. Fisher himself was an accomplished preacher and writer. His sermons on the penitential psalms were reprinted seven times before his death. With the coming of Lutheranism, he was drawn into controversy. His eight books against heresy gave him a leading position among European theologians.\nIn 1521, Fisher was asked to study the question of King Henry VIII\u2019s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, his brother\u2019s widow. He incurred Henry\u2019s anger by defending the validity of the king\u2019s marriage with Catherine, and later by rejecting Henry\u2019s claim to be the supreme head of the Church of England.\nIn an attempt to be rid of him, Henry first had Fisher accused of not reporting all the \u201crevelations\u201d of the nun of Kent, Elizabeth Barton. In feeble health, Fisher was summoned to take the oath to the new Act of Succession. He and Thomas More refused to do so because the Act presumed the legality of Henry\u2019s divorce and his claim to be head of the English Church. They were sent to the Tower of London, where Fisher remained 14 months without trial. Finally both men were sentenced to life imprisonment and loss of goods.\nWhen the two were called to further interrogations, they remained silent. On the supposition that he was speaking privately as a priest, Fisher was tricked into declaring again that the king was not supreme head of the church in England. The king, further angered that the pope had made John Fisher a cardinal, had him brought to trial on the charge of high treason. He was condemned and executed, his body left to lie all day on the scaffold and his head hung on London Bridge. More was executed two weeks later. His\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is June 22.\nReflection\nToday many questions are raised about Christians\u2019 and priests\u2019 active involvement in social issues. John Fisher remained faithful to his calling as a priest and bishop. He strongly upheld the teachings of the Church; the very cause of his martyrdom was his loyalty to Rome. He was involved in the cultural enrichment circles as well as in the political struggles of his time. This involvement caused him to question the moral conduct of the leadership of his country.\n\u201cThe Church has the right, indeed the duty, to proclaim justice on the social, national and international level, and to denounce instances of injustice, when the fundamental rights of man and his very salvation demand it\u201d (Justice in the World, 1971 Synod of Bishops).\n\u00a0",

He began to announce the coming of the Kingdom, and to call everyone to a fundamental reformation of life. His purpose was to prepare the way for Jesus. His baptism, he said, was for repentance. But one would come who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire. John was not worthy even to untie his sandals. His attitude toward Jesus was: \u201cHe must increase; I must decrease\u201d (John 3:30).\nJohn was humbled to find among the crowd of sinners who came to be baptized the one whom he already knew to be the Messiah. \u201cI need to be baptized by you\u201d (Matthew 3:14b). But Jesus insisted, \u201cAllow it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness\u201d (Matthew 3:15b). Jesus, true and humble human as well as eternal God, was eager to do what was required of any good Jew. Jesus thus publicly entered the community of those awaiting the Messiah. But making himself part of that community, he made it truly messianic.\nThe greatness of John, his pivotal place in the history of salvation, is seen in the great emphasis Luke gives to the announcement of his birth and the event itself\u2014both made prominently parallel to the same occurrences in the life of Jesus. John attracted countless people to the banks of the Jordan, and it occurred to some people that he might be the Messiah. But he constantly deferred to Jesus, even to sending away some of his followers to become the first disciples of Jesus.\nPerhaps John\u2019s idea of the coming of the Kingdom of God was not being perfectly fulfilled in the public ministry of Jesus. For whatever reason, when he was in prison he sent his disciples to ask Jesus if he was the Messiah. Jesus\u2019 answer showed that the Messiah was to be a figure like that of the Suffering Servant in Isaiah. John himself would share in the pattern of messianic suffering, losing his life to the revenge of Herodias.\nReflection\nJohn challenges us Christians to the fundamental attitude of Christianity\u2014total dependence on the Father, in Christ. Except for the Mother of God, no one had a higher function in the unfolding of salvation. Yet the least in the kingdom, Jesus said, is greater than he, for the pure gift that the Father gives. The attractiveness as well as the austerity of John, his fierce courage in denouncing evil\u2014all stem from his fundamental and total placing of his life within the will of God.\nSaint John the Baptist is the Patron Saint of:\nBaptism\n\n\u00a0",

The two were set to make a pilgrimage together to the holy places in Jerusalem, but her husband died on the way. The newly widowed Jutta, after taking care to provide for her children, resolved to live in a manner she felt was utterly pleasing to God. She disposed of the costly clothes, jewels, and furniture befitting one of her rank, and became a Secular Franciscan, taking on the simple garment of a religious.\nFrom that point her life was utterly devoted to others: caring for the sick, particularly lepers; tending to the poor, whom she visited in their hovels; helping the crippled and blind with whom she shared her own home. Many of the townspeople of Thuringia laughed at how the once-distinguished lady now spent all her time. But Jutta saw the face of God in the poor and felt honored to render whatever services she could.\nAbout the year 1260, not long before her death, Jutta lived near the non-Christians in eastern Germany. There she built a small hermitage and prayed unceasingly for their conversion. She has been venerated for centuries as the special patron of Prussia.\nReflection\nJesus once said that a camel can pass through a needle\u2019s eye more easily than a rich person can enter God\u2019s realm.

Cyril, recognized as a great teacher of the Church, began his career as archbishop of Alexandria, Egypt, with impulsive, often violent, actions. He pillaged and closed the churches of the Novatian heretics\u2014who required those who denied the faith to be re-baptized\u2014participated in the deposing of Saint\u00a0John Chrysostom, and confiscated Jewish property, expelling the Jews from Alexandria in retaliation for their attacks on Christians.\nCyril\u2019s importance for theology and Church history lies in his championing the cause of orthodoxy against the heresy of Nestorius, who taught that in Christ there were two persons, one human and one divine.\nThe controversy centered around the two natures in Christ. Nestorius would not agree to the title \u201cGod-bearer\u201d for Mary. He preferred \u201cChrist-bearer,\u201d saying there are two distinct persons in Christ\u2014divine and human\u2014joined only by a moral union. He said Mary was not the mother of God but only of the man Christ, whose humanity was only a temple of God. Nestorianism implied that the humanity of Christ was a mere disguise.\nPresiding as the pope\u2019s representative at the Council of Ephesus in 431, Cyril condemned Nestorianism and proclaimed Mary truly the \u201cGod-bearer\u201d\u2014the mother of the one Person who is truly God and truly human. In the confusion that followed, Cyril was deposed and imprisoned for three months, after which he was welcomed back to Alexandria.\nBesides needing to soften some of his opposition to those who had sided with Nestorius, Cyril had difficulties with some of his own allies, who thought he had gone too far, sacrificing not only language but orthodoxy. Until his death, his policy of moderation kept his extreme partisans under control. On his deathbed, despite pressure, he refused to condemn the teacher of Nestorius.\nReflection\nLives of the saints are valuable not only for the virtue they reveal but also for the less admirable qualities that also appear. Holiness is a gift of God to us as human beings. Life is a process. We respond to God\u2019s gift, but sometimes with a lot of zigzagging. If Cyril had been more patient and diplomatic, the Nestorian church might not have risen and maintained power so long. But even saints must grow out of immaturity, narrowness, and selfishness. It is because they\u2014and we\u2014do grow, that we are truly saints, persons who live the life of God.\n\n\u00a0",

He was a student, well trained no doubt, with great patience in investigating, tremendously protective of apostolic teaching, but prompted more by a desire to win over his opponents than to prove them in error.\nAs bishop of Lyons he was especially concerned with the Gnostics, who took their name from the Greek word for \u201cknowledge.\u201d Claiming access to secret knowledge imparted by Jesus to only a few disciples, their teaching was attracting and confusing many Christians. After thoroughly investigating the various Gnostic sects and their \u201csecret,\u201d Irenaeus showed to what logical conclusions their tenets led. These he contrasted with the teaching of the apostles and the text of Holy Scripture, giving us, in five books, a system of theology of great importance to subsequent times. Moreover, his work, widely used and translated into Latin and Armenian, gradually ended the influence of the Gnostics.\nThe circumstances and details about his death, like those of his birth and early life in Asia Minor, are not at all clear.\nReflection\nA deep and genuine concern for other people will remind us that the discovery of truth is not to be a victory for some and a defeat for others. Unless all can claim a share in that victory, truth itself will continue to be rejected by the losers, because it will be regarded as inseparable from the yoke of defeat.

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaints Peter and Paul\u2019s Story\nPeter (d. 64?)\u00a0Saint\u00a0Mark ends the first half of his Gospel with a triumphant climax. He has recorded doubt, misunderstanding, and the opposition of many to Jesus. Now Peter makes his great confession of faith: \u201cYou are the Messiah\u201d (Mark 8:29b). It was one of the many glorious moments in Peter\u2019s life, beginning with the day he was called from his nets along the Sea of Galilee to become a fisher of men for Jesus.\nThe New Testament clearly shows Peter as the leader of the apostles, chosen by Jesus to have a special relationship with him. With James and John he was privileged to witness the Transfiguration, the raising of a dead child to life, and the agony in Gethsemane. His mother-in-law was cured by Jesus. He was sent with John to prepare for the last Passover before Jesus\u2019 death. His name is first on every list of apostles.\nAnd to Peter only did Jesus say, \u201cBlessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\u201d (Matthew 16:17b-19).\nBut the Gospels prove their own trustworthiness by the unflattering details they include about Peter. He clearly had no public relations person. It is a great comfort for ordinary mortals to know that Peter also has his human weakness, even in the presence of Jesus.\nHe generously gave up all things, yet he can ask in childish self-regard, \u201cWhat are we going to get for all this?\u201d (see Matthew 19:27). He receives the full force of Christ\u2019s anger when he objects to the idea of a suffering Messiah: \u201cGet behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me. You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do\u201d (Matthew 16:23b).\nPeter is willing to accept Jesus\u2019 doctrine of forgiveness, but suggests a limit of seven times. He walks on the water in faith, but sinks in doubt. He refuses to let Jesus wash his feet, then wants his whole body cleansed. He swears at the Last Supper that he will never deny Jesus, and then swears to a servant maid that he has never known the man. He loyally resists the first attempt to arrest Jesus by cutting off Malchus\u2019 ear, but in the end he runs away with the others. In the depth of his sorrow, Jesus looks on him and forgives him, and he goes out and sheds bitter tears. The Risen Jesus told Peter to feed his lambs and his sheep (John 21:15-17).\nPaul (d. 64?)\u00a0If the most well-known preacher today suddenly began preaching that the United States should adopt Marxism and not rely on the Constitution, the angry reaction would help us understand Paul\u2019s life when he started preaching that Christ alone can save us. He had been the most pharisaic of Pharisees, the most legalistic of Mosaic lawyers. Now he suddenly appears to other Jews as a heretical welcomer of Gentiles, a traitor and apostate.\nPaul\u2019s central conviction was simple and absolute: Only God can save humanity. No human effort\u2014even the most scrupulous observance of law\u2014can create a human good which we can bring to God as reparation for sin and payment for grace. To be saved from itself, from sin, from the devil, and from death, humanity must open itself completely to the saving power of Jesus.\nPaul never lost his love for his Jewish family, though he carried on a lifelong debate with them about the uselessness of the Law without Christ. He reminded the Gentiles that they were grafted on the parent stock of the Jews, who were still God\u2019s chosen people, the children of the promise.\nReflection\nWe would probably go to confession to Peter sooner than to any of the other apostles. He is perhaps a more striking example of the simple fact of holiness. Jesus says to us as he said, in effect, to Peter: \u201cIt is not you who have chosen me, but I who have chosen you. Peter, it is not human wisdom that makes it possible for you to believe, but my Father\u2019s revelation. I, not you, build my Church.\u201d Paul\u2019s experience of the risen Jesus on the road to Damascus was the driving force that made him one of the most zealous, dynamic, and courageous ambassadors of Christ the Church has ever had. But persecution, humiliation, and weakness became his day-by-day carrying of the cross, material for further transformation. The dying Christ was in him; the living Christ was his life.\nSaint Paul is the Patron Saint of:\nGreece\n\n\u00a0",

Paul had not yet visited them at the time he wrote his great letter in 57-58 A.D.\nThere was a large Jewish population in Rome. Probably as a result of controversy between Jews and Jewish Christians, the Emperor Claudius expelled all Jews from Rome in 49-50 A.D. Suetonius the historian says that the expulsion was due to disturbances in the city \u201ccaused by the certain Chrestus\u201d [Christ]. Perhaps many came back after Claudius\u2019 death in 54 A.D. Paul\u2019s letter was addressed to a Church with members from Jewish and Gentile backgrounds.\nIn July of 64 A.D., more than half of Rome was destroyed by fire. Rumor blamed the tragedy on Nero, who wanted to enlarge his palace. He shifted the blame by accusing the Christians. According to the historian Tacitus, many Christians were put to death because of their \u201chatred of the human race.\u201d Peter and Paul were probably among the victims.\nThreatened by an army revolt and condemned to death by the senate, Nero committed suicide in 68 A.D. at the age of 31.\nReflection\nWherever the Good News of Jesus was preached, it met the same opposition as Jesus did, and many of those who began to follow him shared his suffering and death. But no human force could stop the power of the Spirit unleashed upon the world. The blood of martyrs has always been, and will always be, the seed of Christians.\n\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Solemnity of All Saints\nThe earliest certain observance of a feast in honor of all the saints is an early fourth-century commemoration of \u201call the martyrs.\u201d In the early seventh century, after successive waves of invaders plundered the catacombs, Pope Boniface IV gathered up some 28 wagon-loads of bones and reinterred them beneath the Pantheon, a Roman temple dedicated to all the gods. The pope rededicated the shrine as a Christian church. According to Venerable Bede, the pope intended \u201cthat the memory of all the saints might in the future be honored in the place which had formerly been dedicated to the worship not of gods but of demons\u201d (On the Calculation of Time).\n\nBut the rededication of the Pantheon, like the earlier commemoration of all the martyrs, occurred in May. Many Eastern Churches still honor all the saints in the spring, either during the Easter season or immediately after Pentecost.\nHow the Western Church came to celebrate this feast, now recognized as a solemnity, in November is a puzzle to historians. The Anglo-Saxon theologian Alcuin observed the feast on November 1 in 800, as did his friend Arno, Bishop of Salzburg. Rome finally adopted that date in the ninth century.\nReflection\nThis feast first honored martyrs. Later, when Christians were free to worship according to their consciences, the Church acknowledged other paths to sanctity. In the early centuries the only criterion was popular acclaim, even when the bishop\u2019s approval became the final step in placing a commemoration on the calendar. The first papal canonization occurred in 993; the lengthy process now required to prove extraordinary sanctity took form in the last 500 years. Today\u2019s feast honors the obscure as well as the famous\u2014the saints each of us have known.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed\nThe Church has encouraged prayer for the dead from the earliest times as an act of Christian charity. \u201cIf we had no care for the dead,\u201d Augustine noted, \u201cwe would not be in the habit of praying for them.\u201d Yet pre-Christian rites for the deceased retained such a strong hold on the superstitious imagination that a liturgical commemoration was not observed until the early Middle Ages, when monastic communities began to mark an annual day of prayer for the departed members.\nIn the middle of the 11th century, Saint\u00a0Odilo, abbot of Cluny, France, decreed that all Cluniac monasteries offer special prayers and sing the Office for the Dead on November 2, the day after the feast of All Saints. The custom spread from Cluny and was finally adopted throughout the Roman Church.\nThe theological underpinning of the feast is the acknowledgment of human frailty. Since few people achieve perfection in this life but, rather, go to the grave still scarred with traces of sinfulness, some period of purification seems necessary before a soul comes face-to-face with God. The Council of Trent affirmed this purgatory state and insisted that the prayers of the living can speed the process of purification.\nSuperstition easily clung to the observance. Medieval popular belief held that the souls in purgatory could appear on this day in the form of witches, toads or will-o\u2019-the-wisps. Graveside food offerings supposedly eased the rest of the dead.\nObservances of a more religious nature have survived. These include public processions or private visits to cemeteries and decorating graves with flowers and lights. This feast is observed with great fervor in Mexico.\nReflection\nWhether or not one should pray for the dead is one of the great arguments which divide Christians. Appalled by the abuse of indulgences in the Church of his day, Martin Luther rejected the concept of purgatory. Yet prayer for a loved one is, for the believer, a way of erasing any distance, even death. In prayer we stand in God\u2019s presence in the company of someone we love, even if that person has gone before us into death.\n",

Like many others, Martin might have grown to be a bitter man, but he did not. It was said that even as a child he gave his heart and his goods to the poor and despised.\nHe was the son of a freed woman of Panama, probably black but also possibly of indigenous stock, and a Spanish grandee of Lima, Peru. His parents never married each other. Martin inherited the features and dark complexion of his mother. That irked his father, who finally acknowledged his son after eight years. After the birth of a sister, the father abandoned the family. Martin was reared in poverty, locked into a low level of Lima\u2019s society.\nWhen he was 12, his mother apprenticed him to a barber-surgeon. Martin learned how to cut hair and also how to draw blood\u2014a standard medical treatment then\u2014care for wounds, and prepare and administer medicines.\nAfter a few years in this medical apostolate, Martin applied to the Dominicans to be a \u201clay helper,\u201d not feeling himself worthy to be a religious brother. After nine years, the example of his prayer and penance, charity and humility, led the community to request him to make full religious profession. Many of his nights were spent in prayer and penitential practices; his days were filled with nursing the sick and caring for the poor. It was particularly impressive that he treated all people regardless of their color, race, or status. He was instrumental in founding an orphanage, took care of slaves brought from Africa, and managed the daily alms of the priory with practicality, as well as generosity. He became the procurator for both priory and city, whether it was a matter of \u201cblankets, shirts, candles, candy, miracles or prayers!\u201d When his priory was in debt, he said, \u201cI am only a poor mulatto. Sell me. I am the property of the order. Sell me.\u201d\nSide by side with his daily work in the kitchen, laundry, and infirmary, Martin\u2019s life reflected God\u2019s extraordinary gifts: ecstasies that lifted him into the air, light filling the room where he prayed, bi-location, miraculous knowledge, instantaneous cures, and a remarkable rapport with animals. His charity extended to beasts of the field and even to the vermin of the kitchen. He would excuse the raids of mice and rats on the grounds that they were underfed; he kept stray cats and dogs at his sister\u2019s house.\nMartin became a formidable fundraiser, obtaining thousands of dollars for dowries for poor girls so that they could marry or enter a convent.\nMany of his fellow religious took Martin as their spiritual director, but he continued to call himself a \u201cpoor slave.\u201d He was a good friend of another Dominican saint of Peru, Rose of Lima.\nReflection\nRacism is a sin almost nobody confesses. Like pollution, it is a \u201csin of the world\u201d that is everybody\u2019s responsibility but apparently nobody\u2019s fault. One could hardly imagine a more fitting patron of Christian forgiveness\u2013on the part of those discriminated against\u2014and Christian justice\u2014on the part of reformed racists\u2014than Martin de Porres.\nSaint Martin de Porres is the Patron Saint of:\nAfrican Americans\nBarbers\nHairdressers\nRace Relations\nRadio\nSocial Justice\nAnother Saint of the Day for November 3 is Saint Hubert.\n\n",

He lived during the time of the Protestant Reformation, and had a hand in the reform of the whole Church during the final years of the Council of Trent.\nAlthough he belonged to the Milanese nobility and was related to the powerful Medici family, Charles desired to devote himself to the Church. In 1559, when his uncle, Cardinal de Medici was elected Pope Pius IV, he made Charles cardinal-deacon and administrator of the Archdiocese of Milan. At the time Charles was still a layman and a young student. Because of his intellectual qualities Charles was entrusted with several important offices connected with the Vatican, and later appointed secretary of state with responsibility for the papal states. The untimely death of his elder brother brought Charles to a definite decision to be ordained a priest, despite his relatives\u2019 insistence that he marry. Soon after being ordained a priest at age 25, Borromeo was consecrated bishop of Milan.\nWorking behind the scenes, Saint Charles deserves the credit for keeping the Council of Trent in session when at several points it was on the verge of breaking up. Borromeo\u00a0encouraged the pope to renew the Council in 1562, after it had been suspended for 10 years. He took upon himself the task of the entire correspondence during the final phase. Because of his work at the Council, Borromeo was unable to take up residence in Milan until the Council concluded.\nEventually, Borromeo was allowed to devote his time to the Archdiocese of Milan, where the religious and moral picture was far from bright. The reform needed in every phase of Catholic life among both clergy and laity was initiated at a provincial council of all the bishops under him. Specific regulations were drawn up for bishops and other clergy: If the people were to be converted to a better life, Borromeo had to be the first to give a good example and renew their apostolic spirit.\nCharles took the initiative in giving a good example. He allotted most of his income to charity, forbade himself all luxury, and imposed severe penances upon himself. He sacrificed wealth, high honors, esteem, and influence to become poor. During the plague and famine of 1576, Borromeo tried to feed 60,000 to 70,000 people daily. To do this he borrowed large sums of money that required years to repay. Whereas the civil authorities fled at the height of the plague, he stayed in the city, where he ministered to the sick and the dying, helping those in want.\nWork and the heavy burdens of his high office began to affect Archbishop Borromeo\u2019s health, leading to his death at the age of 46.\nReflection\nSaint Charles Borromeo made his own the words of Christ: \u201c\u2026I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me\u201d (Matthew 25:35-36). Borromeo saw Christ in his neighbor, and knew that charity done for the least of his flock was charity done for Christ.\nSaint Charles Borromeo is the Patron Saint of:\nCatechists\nCatechumens\nSeminarians\n",

His principal weapon was the short sermon, and many of them have come down to us. They do not contain great originality of thought. They are, however, full of moral applications, sound in doctrine, and historically significant in that they reveal Christian life in fifth-century Ravenna. So authentic were the contents of his sermons that some 13 centuries later, he was declared a doctor of the Church by Pope Benedict XIII. He who had earnestly sought to teach and motivate his own flock was recognized as a teacher of the universal Church.\nIn addition to his zeal in the exercise of his office, Peter Chrysologus was distinguished by a fierce loyalty to the Church, not only in its teaching, but in its authority as well. He looked upon learning not as a mere opportunity but as an obligation for all, both as a development of God-given faculties and as a solid support for the worship of God.\nSome time before his death around A.D. 450, Saint\u00a0Peter Chrysologus returned to his birthplace of Imola, in northern Italy.\nReflection\nQuite likely, it was Saint\u00a0Peter Chrysologus\u2019 attitude toward learning that gave substance to his exhortations. Next to virtue, learning, in his view, was the greatest improvement\u00a0to the human mind and the support of true religion. Ignorance is not a virtue, nor is anti-intellectualism. Knowledge is neither more nor less a source of pride than physical, administrative, or financial prowess.

In later years, he was identified as John Duns Scotus to indicate the land of his birth; Scotia is the Latin name for Scotland.\nJohn received the habit of the Friars Minor at Dumfries, where his uncle Elias Duns was superior. After novitiate, John studied at Oxford and Paris and was ordained in 1291. More studies in Paris followed until 1297, when he returned to lecture at Oxford and Cambridge. Four years later, he returned to Paris to teach and complete the requirements for the doctorate.\nIn an age when many people adopted whole systems of thought without qualification, John pointed out the richness of the Augustinian-Franciscan tradition, appreciated the wisdom of Aquinas, Aristotle, and the Muslim philosophers\u2014and still managed to be an independent thinker. That quality was proven in 1303, when King Philip the Fair tried to enlist the University of Paris on his side in a dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. John Duns Scotus dissented, and was given three days to leave France.\nIn Scotus\u2019s time, some philosophers held that people are basically determined by forces outside themselves. Free will is an illusion, they argued. An ever-practical man, Scotus said that if he started beating someone who denied free will, the person would immediately tell him to stop. But if Scotus didn\u2019t really have a free will, how could he stop? John had a knack for finding illustrations his students could remember!\nAfter a short stay in Oxford, Scotus returned to Paris, where he received the doctorate in 1305. He continued teaching there and in 1307 so ably defended the Immaculate Conception of Mary that the university officially adopted his position.

As love becomes more perfect and intense, freedom becomes more noble and integral both in God and in man\u201d (New Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 4, p. 1105).\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nStory of the Dedication of St. John Lateran\nMost Catholics think of St. Peter\u2019s as the pope\u2019s main church, but they are wrong. St. John Lateran is the pope\u2019s church, the cathedral of the Diocese of Rome where the Bishop of Rome presides.\nThe first basilica on the site was built in the fourth century when Constantine donated land he had received from the wealthy Lateran family. That structure and its successors suffered fire, earthquake, and the ravages of war, but the Lateran remained the church where popes were consecrated. In the 14th century when the papacy returned to Rome from Avignon, the church and the adjoining palace were found to be in ruins.\nPope Innocent X commissioned the present structure in 1646. One of Rome\u2019s most imposing churches, the Lateran\u2019s towering facade is crowned with 15 colossal statues of Christ, John the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and 12 doctors of the Church. Beneath its high altar rest the remains of the small wooden table on which tradition holds Saint\u00a0Peter himself celebrated Mass.\nReflection\nUnlike the commemorations of other Roman churches, this anniversary is a feast. The dedication of a church is a feast for all its parishioners. In a sense, St. John Lateran is the parish church of all Catholics, because it is the pope\u2019s cathedral. This church is the spiritual home of the people who are the Church.\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Leo the Great\u2019s Story\nWith apparent strong conviction of the importance of the Bishop of Rome in the Church, and of the Church as the ongoing sign of Christ\u2019s presence in the world, Leo the Great displayed endless dedication as pope. Elected in 440, he worked tirelessly as \u201cPeter\u2019s successor,\u201d guiding his fellow bishops as \u201cequals in the episcopacy and infirmities.\u201d\nLeo is known as one of the best administrative popes of the ancient Church. His work branched into four main areas, indicative of his notion of the pope\u2019s total responsibility for the flock of Christ. He worked at length to control the heresies of Pelagianism\u2014overemphasizing human freedom\u2014Manichaeism\u2014seeing everything material as evil\u2014and others, placing demands on their followers so as to secure true Christian beliefs.\nA second major area of his concern was doctrinal controversy in the Church in the East, to which he responded with a classic letter setting down the Church\u2019s teaching on the two natures of Christ. With strong faith, he also led the defense of Rome against barbarian attack, taking the role of peacemaker.\nIn these three areas, Leo\u2019s work has been highly regarded. His growth to sainthood has its basis in the spiritual depth with which he approached the pastoral care of his people, which was the fourth focus of his work. He is known for his spiritually profound sermons. An instrument of the call to holiness, well-versed in Scripture and ecclesiastical awareness, Leo had the ability to reach the everyday needs and interests of his people. One of his sermons is used in the Office of Readings on Christmas.\nIt is said of Leo that his true significance rests in his doctrinal insistence on the mysteries of Christ and the Church and in the supernatural charisms of the spiritual life given to humanity in Christ and in his Body, the Church. Thus Leo held firmly that everything he did and said as pope for the administration of the Church represented Christ, the head of the Mystical Body, and Saint\u00a0Peter, in whose place Leo acted.\nReflection\nAt a time when there is widespread criticism of Church structures, we also hear criticism that bishops and priests\u2014indeed, all of us\u2014are too preoccupied with administration of temporal matters. Pope Leo is an example of a great administrator who used his talents in areas where spirit and structure are inseparably combined: doctrine, peace, and pastoral care. He avoided an \u201cangelism\u201d that tries to live without the body, as well as the \u201cpracticality\u201d that deals only in externals.\n\n",

Martin became a Christian catechumen and was baptized when he was 18. It was said that he lived more like a monk than a soldier. At 23, he refused a war bonus and told his commander: \u201cI have served you as a soldier; now let me serve Christ. Give the bounty to those who are going to fight. But I am a soldier of Christ and it is not lawful for me to fight.\u201d After great difficulties, he was discharged and went to be a disciple of Hilary of Poitiers.\nHe was ordained an exorcist and worked with great zeal against the Arians. Martin became a monk, living first at Milan and later on a small island. When Hilary was restored to his see following his exile, Martin returned to France and established what may have been the first French monastery near Poitiers. He lived there for 10 years, forming his disciples and preaching throughout the countryside.\nThe people of Tours demanded that he become their bishop. Martin was drawn to that city by a ruse\u2014the need of a sick person\u2014and was brought to the church, where he reluctantly allowed himself to be consecrated bishop. Some of the consecrating bishops thought his rumpled appearance and unkempt hair indicated that he was not dignified enough for the office.\nAlong with Saint\u00a0Ambrose, Martin rejected Bishop Ithacius\u2019s principle of putting heretics to death\u2014as well as the intrusion of the emperor into such matters. He prevailed upon the emperor to spare the life of the heretic Priscillian. For his efforts, Martin was accused of the same heresy, and Priscillian was executed after all. Martin then pleaded for a cessation of the persecution of Priscillian\u2019s followers in Spain. He still felt he could cooperate with Ithacius in other areas, but afterwards his conscience troubled him about this decision.\nAs death approached, Martin\u2019s followers begged him not to leave them. He prayed, \u201cLord, if your people still need me, I do not refuse the work. Your will be done.\u201d\nReflection\nMartin\u2019s worry about cooperation with evil reminds us that almost nothing is either all black or all white. The saints are not creatures of another world: They face the same perplexing decisions that we do. Any decision of conscience always involves some risk. If we choose to go north, we may never know what would have happened had we gone east, west, or south. A hyper-cautious withdrawal from all perplexing situations is not the virtue of prudence; it is in fact, a bad decision, for \u201cnot to decide is to decide.\u201d\nSaint Martin of Tours is the Patron Saint of:\nHorses\nSoldiers\nSouth Africa\n\n",

John Kunsevich\u2014who took the name Josaphat in religious life\u2014was to dedicate his life, and die for the same cause. Born in what is now Ukraine, he went to work in Wilno and was influenced by clergy adhering to the 1596 Union of Brest. He became a Basilian monk, then a priest, and soon was well known as a preacher and an ascetic.\nHe became bishop of Vitebsk at a relatively young age, and faced a difficult situation. Most monks, fearing interference in liturgy and customs, did not want union with Rome. By synods, catechetical instruction, reform of the clergy, and personal example, however, Josaphat was successful in winSt\nning the greater part of the Orthodox in that area to the union.\nBut the next year a dissident hierarchy was set up, and his opposite number spread the accusation that Josaphat had \u201cgone Latin\u201d and that all his people would have to do the same. He was not enthusiastically supported by the Latin bishops of Poland.\nDespite warnings, he went to Vitebsk, still a hotbed of trouble. Attempts were made to foment trouble and drive him from the diocese: A priest was sent to shout insults to him from his own courtyard. When Josaphat had him removed and shut up in his house, the opposition rang the town hall bell, and a mob assembled. The priest was released, but members of the mob broke into the bishop\u2019s home. Josaphat was struck with a halberd, then shot, and his body thrown into the river. It was later recovered and is now buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome. He was the first saint of the Eastern Church to be canonized by Rome.\nJosaphat\u2019s death brought a movement toward Catholicism and unity, but the controversy continued, and the dissidents, too, had their martyr. After the partition of Poland, the Russians forced most Ruthenians to join the Russian Orthodox Church.\nReflection\nThe seeds of separation were sown in the fourth century when the Roman Empire was divided into East and West. The actual split came over customs such as using unleavened bread, Saturday fasting, and celibacy. No doubt the political involvement of religious leaders on both sides was a large factor, and doctrinal disagreement was present. But no reason was enough to justify the present tragic division in Christendom, which is 64 percent Roman Catholic, 13 percent Eastern\u2014mostly Orthodox\u2014Churches, and 23 percent Protestant, and this when the 71 percent of the world that is not Christian should be experiencing unity and Christ-like charity from Christians!\n\n",

Her deep trust in the loving care of her God gave her the strength to be a valiant woman doing the work of Christ.\nRefused admission to the religious order which had educated her to be a teacher, she began charitable work at the House of Providence Orphanage in Cadogno, Italy. In September 1877, she made her vows there and took the religious habit.\nWhen the bishop closed the orphanage in 1880, he named Frances prioress of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. Seven young women from the orphanage joined her.\nSince her early childhood in Italy, Frances had wanted to be a missionary in China but, at the urging of Pope Leo XIII, Frances went west instead of east. She traveled with six sisters to New York City to work with the thousands of Italian immigrants living there.\nShe found disappointment and difficulties with every step. When she arrived in New York, the house intended to be her first orphanage in the United States was not available. The archbishop advised her to return to Italy. But Frances, truly a valiant woman, departed from the archbishop\u2019s residence all the more determined to establish that orphanage. And she did.\nIn 35 years, Frances Xavier Cabrini founded 67 institutions dedicated to caring for the poor, the abandoned, the uneducated and the sick. Seeing great need among Italian immigrants who were losing their faith, she organized schools and adult education classes.\nAs a child, she was always frightened of water, unable to overcome her fear of drowning. Yet, despite this fear, she traveled across the Atlantic Ocean more than 30 times. She died of malaria in her own Columbus Hospital in Chicago.\nReflection\nThe compassion and dedication of Mother Cabrini is still seen in hundreds of thousands of her fellow citizens who care for the sick in hospitals, nursing homes, and state institutions. We complain of increased medical costs in an affluent society, but the daily news shows us millions who have little or no medical care, and who are calling for new Mother Cabrinis to become citizen-servants of their land.\nSaint\u00a0Frances Xavier Cabrini is the Patron Saint of:\nHospital Administrators\nImmigrants\nImpossible Causes\n",

For her, that meant freedom to love God and serve others.\nNot Scottish by birth, Margaret was the daughter of Princess Agatha of Hungary and the Anglo-Saxon Prince Edward Atheling. She spent much of her youth in the court of her great-uncle, the English king, Edward the Confessor. Her family fled from William the Conqueror and was shipwrecked off the coast of Scotland. King Malcolm befriended them and was captivated by the beautiful, gracious Margaret. They were married at the castle of Dunfermline in 1070.\nMalcolm was good-hearted, but rough and uncultured, as was his country. Because of Malcolm\u2019s love for Margaret, she was able to soften his temper, polish his manners, and help him become a virtuous king. He left all domestic affairs to her, and often consulted her in state matters.\nMargaret tried to improve her adopted country by promoting the arts and education. For religious reform she encouraged synods and was present for the discussions which tried to correct religious abuses common among priests and laypeople, such as simony, usury, and incestuous marriages. With her husband, she founded several churches.\nMargaret was not only a queen, but a mother. She and Malcolm had six sons and two daughters. Margaret personally supervised their religious instruction and other studies.\nAlthough she was very much caught up in the affairs of the household and country, she remained detached from the world. Her private life was austere. She had certain times for prayer and reading Scripture. She ate sparingly and slept little in order to have time for devotions. She and Malcolm kept two Lents, one before Easter and one before Christmas. During these times she always rose at midnight for Mass. On the way home she would wash the feet of six poor persons and give them alms. She was always surrounded by beggars in public and never refused them. It is recorded that she never sat down to eat without first feeding nine orphans and 24 adults.\nIn 1093, King William Rufus made a surprise attack on Alnwick castle. King Malcolm and his oldest son, Edward, were killed. Margaret, already on her deathbed, died four days after her husband.\nReflection\nThere are two ways to be charitable: the\u00a0\u201cclean way\u201d and the \u201cmessy way.\u201d The \u201cclean way\u201d is to give money or clothing to organizations that serve the poor. The \u201cmessy way\u201d is dirtying your own hands in personal service to the poor. Margaret\u2019s outstanding virtue was her love of the poor. Although very generous with material gifts, Margaret also visited the sick and nursed them with her own hands. She and her husband served orphans and the poor on their knees during Advent and Lent.

The daughter of the King of Hungary, Elizabeth chose a life of penance and asceticism when a life of leisure and luxury could easily have been hers. This choice endeared her in the hearts of the common people throughout Europe.\nAt the age of 14, Elizabeth was married to Louis of Thuringia, whom she deeply loved. She bore three children. Under the spiritual direction of a Franciscan friar, she led a life of prayer, sacrifice, and service to the poor and sick. Seeking to become one with the poor, she wore simple clothing. Daily she would take bread to hundreds of the poorest in the land who came to her gate.\nAfter six years of marriage, her husband died in the Crusades, and Elizabeth was grief-stricken. Her husband\u2019s family looked upon her as squandering the royal purse, and mistreated her, finally throwing her out of the palace. The return of her husband\u2019s allies from the Crusades resulted in her being reinstated, since her son was legal heir to the throne.\nIn 1228, Elizabeth joined the Secular Franciscan Order, spending the remaining few years of her life caring for the poor in a hospital which she founded in honor of Saint\u00a0Francis of Assisi. Elizabeth\u2019s health declined, and she died before her 24th birthday in 1231. Her great popularity resulted in her canonization four years later.\nReflection\nElizabeth understood well the lesson Jesus taught when he washed his disciples\u2019 feet at the Last Supper: The Christian must be one who serves the humblest needs of others, even if one serves from an exalted position. Of royal blood, Elizabeth could have lorded it over her subjects. Yet she served them with such a loving heart that her brief life won for her a special place in the hearts of many. Elizabeth is also an example to us in her following the guidance of a spiritual director. Growth in the spiritual life is a difficult process.

In 319, Constantine built a basilica on the site that stood for more than a thousand years until, despite numerous restorations, it threatened to collapse. In 1506, Pope Julius II ordered it razed and reconstructed, but the new basilica was not completed and dedicated for more than two centuries.\nSt. Paul\u2019s Outside-the-Walls stands near the Abaazia delle Tre Fontane, where Saint Paul is believed to have been beheaded. The largest church in Rome until St. Peter\u2019s was rebuilt, the basilica also rises over the traditional site of its namesake\u2019s grave. The most recent edifice was constructed after a fire in 1823. The first basilica was also Constantine\u2019s doing.\nConstantine\u2019s building projects enticed the first of a centuries-long parade of pilgrims to Rome.

Saint Francis himself gave Clare\u2019s sister the name Agnes, because she was gentle like a young lamb.\nAgnes matched her sister in devotion to prayer and in willingness to endure the strict penances that characterized the Poor Ladies\u2019 lives at San Damiano. In 1221, a group of Benedictine nuns in Monticelli near Florence asked to become Poor Ladies. Saint\u00a0Clare sent Agnes to become abbess of that monastery. Agnes soon wrote a rather sad letter about how much she missed Clare and the other nuns at San Damiano. After establishing other monasteries of Poor Ladies in northern Italy, Agnes was recalled to San Damiano in 1253, as Clare lay dying.\nThree months later Agnes followed Clare in death, and was canonized in 1753.\nReflection\nGod must love irony; the world is so full of it. In 1212, many in Assisi surely felt that Clare and Agnes were wasting their lives and were turning their backs on the world. In reality, their lives were tremendously life-giving, and the world has been enriched by the example of these poor contemplatives.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint\u00a0Rose Philippine Duchesne\u2019s Story\nBorn in Grenoble, France, of a family that was among the new rich, Rose learned political skills from her father and a love of the poor from her mother. The dominant feature of her temperament was a strong and dauntless will, which became the material\u2014and the battlefield\u2014of her holiness. She entered the Visitation of Mary convent at 19, and remained despite family opposition. As the French Revolution broke, the convent was closed, and she began taking care of the poor and sick, opened a school for homeless children, and risked her life helping priests in the underground.\nWhen the situation cooled, Rose personally rented the former convent, now a shambles, and tried to revive its religious life. The spirit was gone, however, and soon there were only four nuns left. They joined the infant Society of the Sacred Heart, whose young superior, Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat, would be her lifelong friend.\nIn a short time Rose was a superior and supervisor of the novitiate and a school. But since hearing tales of missionary work in Louisiana as a little girl, her ambition was to go to America and work among the Indians. At 49, she thought this would be her work. With four nuns, she spent 11 weeks at sea en route to New Orleans, and seven weeks more on the Mississippi to St. Louis. She then met one of the many disappointments of her life. The bishop had no place for them to live and work among Native Americans. Instead, he sent her to what she sadly called \u201cthe remotest village in the U.S.,\u201d St. Charles, Missouri. With characteristic drive and courage, she founded the first free school for girls west of the Mississippi.\nThough Rose was as hardy as any of the pioneer women in the wagons rolling west, cold and hunger drove them out\u2014to Florissant, Missouri, where she founded the first Catholic Indian school, adding others in the territory.\n\u201cIn her first decade in America, Mother Duchesne suffered practically every hardship the frontier had to offer, except the threat of Indian massacre\u2014poor lodging, shortages of food, drinking water, fuel and money, forest fires and blazing chimneys, the vagaries of the Missouri climate, cramped living quarters and the privation of all privacy, and the crude manners of children reared in rough surroundings and with only the slightest training in courtesy\u201d (Louise Callan, R.S.C.J., Philippine Duchesne).\nFinally at age 72, retired and in poor health, Rose got her lifelong wish. A mission was founded at Sugar Creek, Kansas, among the Potawatomi and she was taken along. Though she could not learn their language, they soon named her \u201cWoman-Who-Prays-Always.\u201d While others taught, she prayed. Legend has it that Native American children sneaked behind her as she knelt and sprinkled bits of paper on her habit, and came back hours later to find them undisturbed. Rose Duchesne died in 1852, at the age of 83, and was canonized in 1988. The Liturgical Feast of Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne is November 18.\nReflection\nDivine grace channeled Mother Duchesne\u2019s iron will and determination into humility and selflessness, and to a desire not to be made superior. Still, even saints can get involved in silly situations. In an argument with her over a minor change in the sanctuary, a priest threatened to remove the tabernacle. She patiently let herself be criticized by younger nuns for not being progressive enough. For 31 years, she hewed to the line of a dauntless love and an unshakable observance of her religious vows.\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nMary\u2019s presentation was celebrated in Jerusalem in the sixth century. A church was built there in honor of this mystery. The Eastern Church was more interested in the feast, but it does appear in the West in the 11th century. Although the feast at times disappeared from the calendar, in the 16th century it became a feast of the universal Church.\nAs with Mary\u2019s birth, we read of Mary\u2019s presentation in the temple only in apocryphal literature. In what is recognized as an unhistorical account, the Protoevangelium of James tells us that Anna and Joachim offered Mary to God in the Temple when she was 3\u00a0years old. This was to carry out a promise made to God when Anna was still childless.\nThough it cannot be proven historically, Mary\u2019s presentation has an important theological purpose. It continues the impact of the feasts of the Immaculate Conception and of the birth of Mary. It emphasizes that the holiness conferred on Mary from the beginning of her life on earth continued through her early childhood and beyond.\nReflection\nIt is sometimes difficult for modern Westerners to appreciate a feast like this. The Eastern Church, however, was quite open to this feast and even somewhat insistent about celebrating it. Even though the feast has no basis in history, it stresses an important truth about Mary: From the beginning of her life, she was dedicated to God. She herself became a greater temple than any made by hands. God came to dwell in her in a marvelous manner and sanctified her for her unique role in God\u2019s saving work. At the same time, the magnificence of Mary enriches her children. They\u2014we\u2014too are temples of God and sanctified in order that we might enjoy and share in God\u2019s saving work.\n\n",

Through her influence, Valerian was converted, and was martyred along with his brother. The legend about Cecilia\u2019s death says that after being struck three times on the neck with a sword, she lived for three days, and asked the pope to convert her home into a church.\nSince the time of the Renaissance she has usually been portrayed with a viola or a small organ.\nReflection\nLike any good Christian, Cecilia sang in her heart, and sometimes with her voice.

Members of the companions group gave their lives for Christ in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and received beatification during four different occasions between 1900 and 1951. All were canonized during the papacy of Saint John Paul II.\nChristianity came to Vietnam through the Portuguese. Jesuits opened the first permanent mission at Da Nang in 1615. They ministered to Japanese Catholics who had been driven from Japan.\nSevere persecutions were launched at least three times in the 19th century. During the six decades after 1820, between 100,000 and 300,000 Catholics were killed or subjected to great hardship. Foreign missionaries martyred in the first wave included priests of the Paris Mission Society, and Spanish Dominican priests and tertiaries.\nIn 1832, Emperor Minh-Mang banned all foreign missionaries, and tried to make all Vietnamese deny their faith by trampling on a crucifix. Like the priest-holes in Ireland during English persecution, many hiding places were offered in homes of the faithful.\nPersecution broke out again in 1847, when the emperor suspected foreign missionaries and Vietnamese Christians of sympathizing with a rebellion led by of one of his sons.\nThe last of the martyrs were 17 laypersons, one of them a 9-year-old, executed in 1862. That year a treaty with France guaranteed religious freedom to Catholics, but it did not stop all persecution.\nBy 1954, there were over a million Catholics\u2014about seven percent of the population\u2014in the north. Buddhists represented about 60 percent. Persistent persecution forced some 670,000 Catholics to abandon lands, homes and possessions and flee to the south. In 1964, there were still 833,000 Catholics in the north, but many were in prison. In the south, Catholics were enjoying the first decade of religious freedom in centuries, their numbers swelled by refugees.\nDuring the Vietnamese war, Catholics again suffered in the north, and again moved to the south in great numbers. Now reunited, the entire country is under Communist rule.\nReflection\nIt may help a people who associate Vietnam only with a 20th-century war to realize that the cross has long been a part of the lives of the people of that country. Even as some people ask again the unanswered questions about United States involvement and disengagement, the faith rooted in Vietnam\u2019s soil proves hardier than the forces that willed to destroy it.\n\u00a0",

As a young man who was greatly tormented by temptations of the flesh, he sought the advice of a religious woman who had lived a hermit\u2019s life for years. He saw in her answer a call to leave the world. He went first to a monk on an island in Lough Erne, then to the great monastic seat of learning at Bangor.\nAfter many years of seclusion and prayer, he traveled to Gaul with 12 companion missionaries. They won wide respect for the rigor of their discipline, their preaching, and their commitment to charity and religious life in a time characterized by clerical laxity and civil strife. Columban established several monasteries in Europe which became centers of religion and culture.\nLike all saints, he met opposition. Ultimately he had to appeal to the pope against complaints of Frankish bishops, for vindication of his orthodoxy and approval of Irish customs. He reproved the king for his licentious life, insisting that he marry. Since this threatened the power of the queen mother, Columban was deported back to Ireland. His ship ran aground in a storm, and he continued his work in Europe, ultimately arriving in Italy, where he found favor with the king of the Lombards. In his last years he established the famous monastery of Bobbio, where he died. His writings include a treatise on penance and against Arianism, sermons, poetry, and his monastic rule.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast of Saint Columban is November 23.\nReflection\nNow that public sexual license is becoming extreme, we need the Church\u2019s memory of a young man as concerned about chastity as Columban.

Likely, he was born in the first half of the seventh century in southeastern France. That is where he built a monastery that became a popular stopping-off point for pilgrims making their way to Compostela in Spain, and the Holy Land.\nIn England, many ancient churches and hospitals were dedicated to Giles. One of the sections of the city of Brussels is named after him. In Germany, Giles was included among the so-called 14 Holy Helpers, a popular group of saints to whom people prayed, especially for recovery from disease, and for strength at the hour of death. Also among the 14 were Saints\u00a0Christopher, Barbara, and Blaise. Interestingly, Giles was the only non-martyr among them. Devotion to the \u201cHoly Helpers\u201d was especially strong in parts of Germany and in Hungary and Sweden. Such devotion made his popularity spread. Giles was soon invoked as the patron of the poor and the disabled.\nThe pilgrimage center that once drew so many fell into disrepair some centuries after Giles\u2019 death.\nReflection\nSaint Giles may not have been a martyr but, as the word martyr means, he was a true witness to the faith. This is attested to by the faith of the People of God in the Middle Ages. He became one of the \u201choly helpers\u201d and can still function in that role for us today.\nSaint Giles is the Patron Saint of:\nBeggars\nThe Disabled\nDisasters\nThe Poor\nTwo additional Saints of the Day for September 1 are\u00a0Saint Beatrice of Silva\u00a0and\u00a0Saint Fiacre.\n",

Though their martyrdom spans a period of several years, they stand together in the Church\u2019s memory because they all gave their lives for the same principle. In 1791, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy required all priests to take an oath which amounted to a denial of the faith. Each of these men refused and was executed.\nJohn Francis Burt\u00e9 became a Franciscan at 16 and after ordination taught theology to the young friars. Later he was guardian of the large Conventual friary in Paris until he was arrested and held in the convent of the Carmelites.\nAppolinaris of Posat was born in 1739 in Switzerland. He joined the Capuchins and acquired a reputation as an excellent preacher, confessor, and instructor of clerics. Preparing for his assignment to the East as a missionary, he was in Paris studying Oriental languages when the French Revolution began. Refusing the oath, he was swiftly arrested and detained in the Carmelite convent.\nSeverin Girault, a member of the Third Order Regular, was a chaplain for a group of sisters in Paris. Imprisoned with the others, he was the first to die in the slaughter at the convent.\nThese three plus 182 others\u2014including several bishops and many religious and diocesan priests\u2014were massacred at the Carmelite house in Paris on September 2, 1792. They were beatified in 1926.\nBorn in 1737, John Baptist Triquerie became a Conventual Franciscan. He was the chaplain and confessor of Poor Clare monasteries in three cities before he was arrested for refusing to take the oath. He and 13 diocesan priests were martyred in Laval on January 21, 1794. He was beatified in 1955.\nReflection\n\u201cLiberty, Equality, Fraternity\u201d was the motto of the French Revolution. If individuals have \u201cinalienable rights,\u201d as the Declaration of Independence states, these must come not from the agreement of society\u2014which can be very fragile\u2014but directly from God. Do we believe that? Do we act on it?\n\u00a0",

After five years in office he resigned, founded six monasteries on his Sicilian estate, and became a Benedictine monk in his own home at Rome.\nOrdained a priest, Gregory became one of the pope\u2019s seven deacons, and also served six years in the East as papal representative in Constantinople. He was recalled to become abbot, but at the age of 50 was elected pope by the clergy and people of Rome.\nGregory was direct and firm. He removed unworthy priests from office, forbade taking money for many services, emptied the papal treasury to ransom prisoners of the Lombards and to care for persecuted Jews and the victims of plague and famine. He was very concerned about the conversion of England, sending 40 monks from his own monastery. He is known for his reform of the liturgy, and for strengthening respect for doctrine. Whether he was largely responsible for the revision of \u201cGregorian\u201d chant is disputed.\nGregory lived in a time of perpetual strife with invading Lombards and difficult relations with the East. When Rome itself was under attack, he interviewed the Lombard king.\nHis book, Pastoral Care, on the duties and qualities of a bishop, was read for centuries after his death. He described bishops mainly as physicians whose main duties were preaching and the enforcement of discipline. In his own down-to-earth preaching, Gregory was skilled at applying the daily Gospel to the needs of his listeners. Called \u201cthe Great,\u201d Gregory has been given a place with Augustine, Ambrose, and Jerome, as one of the four key doctors of the Western Church.\nAn Anglican historian has written: \u201cIt is impossible to conceive what would have been the confusion, the lawlessness, the chaotic state of the Middle Ages without the medieval papacy; and of the medieval papacy, the real father is Gregory the Great.\u201d\nReflection\nGregory was content to be a monk, but he willingly served the Church in other ways when asked. He sacrificed his own preferences in many ways, especially when he was called to be Bishop of Rome. Once he was called to public service, Gregory gave his considerable energies completely to this work. Gregory\u2019s description of bishops as physicians fits in well with Pope Francis\u2019 description of the Church as a \u201cfield hospital.\u201d\nSaint Gregory the Great is the Patron Saint of:\nEngland\nEpilepsy\nMusicians\nTeachers\n\u00a0",

Among those present were hundreds of Missionaries of Charity, the order she founded in 1950, as a diocesan religious community. Today the congregation also includes contemplative sisters and brothers and an order of priests.\nBorn to Albanian parents in what is now Skopje, Macedonia, Gonxha (Agnes) Bojaxhiu was the youngest of the three children who survived. For a time, the family lived comfortably, and her father\u2019s construction business thrived. But life changed overnight following his unexpected death.\nDuring her years in public school, Agnes participated in a Catholic sodality and showed a strong interest in the foreign missions. At age 18, she entered the Loreto Sisters of Dublin. It was 1928 when she said goodbye to her mother for the final time and made her way to a new land and a new life. The following year she was sent to the Loreto novitiate in Darjeeling, India. There she chose the name Teresa and prepared for a life of service. She was assigned to a high school for girls in Calcutta, where she taught history and geography to the daughters of the wealthy. But she could not escape the realities around her\u2014the poverty, the suffering, the overwhelming numbers of destitute people.\n\nIn 1946, while riding a train to Darjeeling to make a retreat, Sister Teresa heard what she later explained as \u201ca call within a call. The message was clear. I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them.\u201d She also heard a call to give up her life with the Sisters of Loreto and instead, to \u201cfollow Christ into the slums to serve him among the poorest of the poor.\u201d\nAfter receiving permission to leave Loreto, establish a new religious community, and undertake her new work, Sister Teresa took a nursing course for several months. She returned to Calcutta, where she lived in the slums and opened a school for poor children. Dressed in a white sari and sandals\u2013the ordinary dress of an Indian woman\u2013she soon began getting to know her neighbors\u2014especially the poor and sick\u2014and getting to know their needs through visits.\nThe work was exhausting, but she was not alone for long. Volunteers who came to join her in the work, some of them former students, became the core of the Missionaries of Charity. Others helped by donating food, clothing, supplies, and the use of buildings. In 1952, the city of Calcutta gave Mother Teresa a former hostel, which became a home for the dying and the destitute. As the order expanded, services were also offered to orphans, abandoned children, alcoholics, the aging, and street people.\nFor the next four decades, Mother Teresa worked tirelessly on behalf of the poor. Her love knew no bounds. Nor did her energy, as she crisscrossed the globe pleading for support and inviting others to see the face of Jesus in the poorest of the poor. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. On September 5, 1997, God called her home. Blessed Teresa was canonized by Pope Francis on September 4, 2016.\nReflection\nMother Teresa\u2019s beatification, just over six years after her death, was part of an expedited process put into effect by Pope John Paul II. Like so many others around the world, he found her love for the Eucharist, for prayer, and for the poor a model for all to emulate.\n",

Through the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, which he founded, his work continues to the present day.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was the fifth of Jean and Marie Ozanam\u2019s 14 children, one of only three to reach adulthood. As a teenager he began having doubts about his religion. Reading and prayer did not seem to help, but long walking discussions with Father Noirot of the Lyons College clarified matters a great deal.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric wanted to study literature, although his father, a doctor, wanted him to become a lawyer. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric yielded to his father\u2019s wishes and in 1831, arrived in Paris to study law at the University of the Sorbonne. When certain professors there mocked Catholic teachings in their lectures, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric defended the Church.\nA discussion club which Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric organized sparked the turning point in his life. In this club, Catholics, atheists, and agnostics debated the issues of the day. Once, after Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric spoke about Christianity\u2019s role in civilization, a club member said: \u201cLet us be frank, Mr. Ozanam; let us also be very particular. What do you do besides talk to prove the faith you claim is in you?\u201d\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was stung by the question. He soon decided that his words needed a grounding in action. He and a friend began visiting Paris tenements and offering assistance as best they could. Soon a group dedicated to helping individuals in need under the patronage of Saint Vincent de Paul formed around Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric.\nFeeling that the Catholic faith needed an excellent speaker to explain its teachings, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric convinced the Archbishop of Paris to appoint Dominican Father Jean-Baptiste Lacordaire, the greatest preacher then in France, to preach a Lenten series in Notre Dame Cathedral. It was well-attended and became an annual tradition in Paris.\nAfter Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric earned his law degree at the Sorbonne, he taught law at the University of Lyons. He also earned a doctorate in literature. Soon after marrying Amelie Soulacroix on June 23, 1841, he returned to the Sorbonne to teach literature. A well-respected lecturer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric worked to bring out the best in each student. Meanwhile, the Saint Vincent de Paul Society was growing throughout Europe. Paris alone counted 25 conferences.\nIn 1846, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, Amelie, and their daughter Marie went to Italy; there he hoped to restore his poor health. They returned the next year. The revolution of 1848 left many Parisians in need of the services of the Saint Vincent de Paul conferences. The unemployed numbered 275,000. The government asked Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and his coworkers to supervise the government aid to the poor. Vincentians throughout Europe came to the aid of Paris.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric then started a newspaper, The New Era, dedicated to securing justice for the poor and the working classes. Fellow Catholics were often unhappy with what Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric wrote. Referring to the poor man as \u201cthe nation\u2019s priest,\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric said that the hunger and sweat of the poor formed a sacrifice that could redeem the people\u2019s humanity.\nIn 1852, poor health again forced Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to return to Italy with his wife and daughter. He died on September 8, 1853. In his sermon at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\u2019s funeral, Fr. Lacordaire described his friend as \u201cone of those privileged creatures who came direct from the hand of God in whom God joins tenderness to genius in order to enkindle the world.\u201d\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was beatified in 1997. Since Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric wrote an excellent book entitled Franciscan Poets of the Thirteenth Century, and since his sense of the dignity of each poor person was so close to the thinking of Saint\u00a0Francis, it seemed appropriate to include him among Franciscan \u201cgreats.\u201d\u00a0His Liturgical Feast Day is September 9.\nReflection\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam always respected the poor while offering whatever service he could. Each man, woman, and child was too precious to live in poverty. Serving the poor taught Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric something about God that he could not have learned elsewhere.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nThe Church has celebrated Mary\u2019s birth since at least the sixth century. A September birth was chosen because the Eastern Church begins its Church year with September. The September 8 date helped determine the date for the feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8.\nScripture does not give an account of Mary\u2019s birth. However, the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James fills in the gap. This work has no historical value, but it does reflect the development of Christian piety. According to this account, Anna and Joachim are infertile but pray for a child. They receive the promise of a child who will advance God\u2019s plan of salvation for the world. Such a story, like many biblical counterparts, stresses the special presence of God in Mary\u2019s life from the beginning.\nSaint\u00a0Augustine connects Mary\u2019s birth with Jesus\u2019 saving work. He tells the earth to rejoice and shine forth in the light of her birth. \u201cShe is the flower of the field from whom bloomed the precious lily of the valley. Through her birth the nature inherited from our first parents is changed.\u201d The opening prayer at Mass speaks of the birth of Mary\u2019s Son as the dawn of our salvation, and asks for an increase of peace.\nReflection\nWe can see every human birth as a call for new hope in the world. The love of two human beings has joined with God in his creative work. The loving parents have shown hope in a world filled with travail. The new child has the potential to be a channel of God\u2019s love and peace to the world.\nThis is all true in a magnificent way in Mary. If Jesus is the perfect expression of God\u2019s love, Mary is the foreshadowing of that love. If Jesus has brought the fullness of salvation, Mary is its dawning.\nBirthday celebrations bring happiness to the celebrant as well as to family and friends. Next to the birth of Jesus, Mary\u2019s birth offers the greatest possible happiness to the world. Each time we celebrate her birth, we can confidently hope for an increase of peace in our hearts and in the world at large.\n",

He sailed into Cartagena, a rich port city washed by the Caribbean. He was ordained there in 1615.\nBy this time the slave trade had been established in the Americas for nearly 100 years, and Cartagena was a chief center for it. Ten thousand slaves poured into the port each year after crossing the Atlantic from West Africa under conditions so foul and inhuman that an estimated one-third of the passengers died in transit. Although the practice of slave-trading was condemned by Pope Paul III and later labeled \u201csupreme villainy\u201d by Pope Pius IX, it continued to flourish.\nPeter Claver\u2019s predecessor, Jesuit Father Alfonso de Sandoval, had devoted himself to the service of the slaves for 40 years before Claver arrived to continue his work, declaring himself \u201cthe slave of the Negroes forever.\u201d\nAs soon as a slave ship entered the port, Peter Claver moved into its infested hold to minister to the ill-treated and exhausted passengers. After the slaves were herded out of the ship like chained animals and shut up in nearby yards to be gazed at by the crowds, Claver plunged in among them with medicines, food, bread, brandy, lemons, and tobacco. With the help of interpreters he gave basic instructions and assured his brothers and sisters of their human dignity and God\u2019s love. During the 40 years of his ministry, Claver instructed and baptized an estimated 300,000 slaves.\nFr. Claver\u2019s apostolate extended beyond his care for slaves. He became a moral force, indeed, the apostle of Cartagena. He preached in the city square, gave missions to sailors and traders as well as country missions, during which he avoided, when possible, the hospitality of the planters and owners and lodged in the slave quarters instead.\nAfter four years of sickness, which forced the saint to remain inactive and largely neglected, Claver died on September 8, 1654. The city magistrates, who had previously frowned at his solicitude for the black outcasts, ordered that he should be buried at public expense and with great pomp.\nPeter Claver was canonized in 1888, and Pope Leo XIII declared him the worldwide patron of missionary work among black slaves.\nReflection\nThe Holy Spirit\u2019s might and power are manifested in the striking decisions and bold actions of Peter Claver. A decision to leave one\u2019s homeland never to return reveals a gigantic act of will difficult for us to imagine. Peter\u2019s determination to serve forever the most abused, rejected, and lowly of all people is stunningly heroic. When we measure our lives against such a man\u2019s, we become aware of our own barely used potential and of our need to open ourselves more to the jolting power of Jesus\u2019 Spirit.\nSaint Peter Claver is the Patron Saint of:\nAfrican Americans\nAfrican Missions\nColombia\nInterracial Justice\n\u00a0",

He received a superior education at the University of Alcala and became a popular professor of philosophy there.\nAfter joining the Augustinian friars at Salamanca, Thomas was ordained and resumed his teaching\u2013despite a continuing absentmindedness and poor memory. He became prior and then provincial of the friars, sending the first Augustinians to the New World. He was nominated by the emperor to the archbishopric of Granada, but refused. When the see again became vacant he was pressured to accept. The money his cathedral chapter gave him to furnish his house was given to a hospital instead. His explanation to them was that \u201cour Lord will be better served by your money being spent on the poor in the hospital. What does a poor friar like myself want with furniture?\u201d\nHe wore the same habit that he had received in the novitiate, mending it himself. The canons and domestics were ashamed of him, but they could not convince him to change. Several hundred poor came to Thomas\u2019s door each morning and received a meal, wine, and money. When criticized because he was at times being taken advantage of, he replied, \u201cIf there are people who refuse to work, that is for the governor and the police to deal with. My duty is to assist and relieve those who come to my door.\u201d He took in orphans and paid his servants for every deserted child they brought to him. He encouraged the wealthy to imitate his example and be richer in mercy and charity than they were in earthly possessions.\nCriticized because he refused to be harsh or swift in correcting sinners, Thomas said, \u201cLet him (the complainer) inquire whether Saint\u00a0Augustine and Saint\u00a0John Chrysostom used anathemas and excommunication to stop the drunkenness and blasphemy which were so common among the people under their care.\u201d\nAs he lay dying, Thomas commanded that all the money he possessed be distributed to the poor. His material goods were to be given to the rector of his college. Mass was being celebrated in his presence when after Communion he breathed his last, reciting the words: \u201cInto your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.\u201d\nIn his lifetime Thomas of Villanova was already called \u201cthe almsgiver\u201d and \u201cthe father of the poor.\u201d He was canonized in 1658. His Liturgical Feast Day is September 22.\nReflection\nThe absent-minded professor is a stock comic figure. Thomas of Villanova earned even more derisive laughs with his determined shabbiness and his willingness to let the poor who flocked to his door take advantage of him. He embarrassed his peers, but Jesus was enormously pleased with him. We are often tempted to tend our image in others\u2019 eyes without paying sufficient attention to how we look to Christ. Thomas still urges us to rethink our priorities.\nOther Saints of the Day for September 10 are Saint Pedro de Corpa and Companions.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Cyprian\u2019s Story\nCyprian is important in the development of Christian thought and practice in the third century, especially in northern Africa.\nHighly educated, a famous orator, he became a Christian as an adult. He distributed his goods to the poor, and amazed his fellow citizens by making a vow of chastity before his baptism. Within two years he had been ordained a priest and was chosen, against his will, as Bishop of Carthage.\nCyprian complained that the peace the Church had enjoyed had weakened the spirit of many Christians and had opened the door to converts who did not have the true spirit of faith. When the Decian persecution began, many Christians easily abandoned the Church. It was their reinstatement that caused the great controversies of the third century, and helped the Church progress in its understanding of the Sacrament of Penance.\nNovatus, a priest who had opposed Cyprian\u2019s election, set himself up in Cyprian\u2019s absence (he had fled to a hiding place from which to direct the Church\u2014bringing criticism on himself) and received back all apostates without imposing any canonical penance. Ultimately he was condemned. Cyprian held a middle course, holding that those who had actually sacrificed to idols could receive Communion only at death, whereas those who had only bought certificates saying they had sacrificed could be admitted after a more or less lengthy period of penance. Even this was relaxed during a new persecution.\nDuring a plague in Carthage, Cyprian urged Christians to help everyone, including their enemies and persecutors.\nA friend of Pope Cornelius, Cyprian opposed the following pope, Stephen. He and the other African bishops would not recognize the validity of baptism conferred by heretics and schismatics. This was not the universal view of the Church, but Cyprian was not intimidated even by Stephen\u2019s threat of excommunication.\nHe was exiled by the emperor and then recalled for trial. He refused to leave the city, insisting that his people should have the witness of his martyrdom.\nCyprian was a mixture of kindness and courage, vigor and steadiness. He was cheerful and serious, so that people did not know whether to love or respect him more. He waxed warm during the baptismal controversy; his feelings must have concerned him, for it was at this time that he wrote his treatise on patience. Saint\u00a0Augustine remarks that Cyprian atoned for his anger by his glorious martyrdom. His Liturgical Feast Day is September 16.\nReflection\nThe controversies about Baptism and Penance in the third century remind us that the early Church had no ready-made solutions from the Holy Spirit. The leaders and members of the Church of that day had to move painfully through the best series of judgments they could make in an attempt to follow the entire teaching of Christ and not be diverted by exaggerations to right or left.\nSaint Cyprian is the Patron Saint of:\nNorth Africa\nAnother Saint of the Day for September 11 is Saint Jean-Gabriel Perboyre.\n\u00a0",

Brought to Constantinople after a dozen years of priestly service in Syria, John found himself the reluctant victim of an imperial ruse to make him bishop in the greatest city of the empire. Ascetic, unimposing but dignified, and troubled by stomach ailments from his desert days as a monk, John became a bishop under the cloud of imperial politics.\nIf his body was weak, his tongue was powerful. The content of his sermons, his exegesis of Scripture, were never without a point. Sometimes the point stung the high and mighty. Some sermons lasted up to two hours.\nHis lifestyle at the imperial court was not appreciated by many courtiers. He offered a modest table to episcopal sycophants hanging around for imperial and ecclesiastical favors. John deplored the court protocol that accorded him precedence before the highest state officials. He would not be a kept man.\nHis zeal led him to decisive action. Bishops who bribed their way into office were deposed. Many of his sermons called for concrete steps to share wealth with the poor. The rich did not appreciate hearing from John that private property existed because of Adam\u2019s fall from grace any more than married men liked to hear that they were bound to marital fidelity just as much as their wives were. When it came to justice and charity, John acknowledged no double standards.\nAloof, energetic, outspoken, especially when he became excited in the pulpit, John was a sure target for criticism and personal trouble. He was accused of gorging himself secretly on rich wines and fine foods. His faithfulness as spiritual director to the rich widow, Olympia, provoked much gossip attempting to prove him a hypocrite where wealth and chastity were concerned. His actions taken against unworthy bishops in Asia Minor were viewed by other ecclesiastics as a greedy, uncanonical extension of his authority.\nTheophilus, archbishop of Alexandria, and Empress Eudoxia were determined to discredit John. Theophilus feared the growth in importance of the Bishop of Constantinople and took occasion to charge John with fostering heresy. Theophilus and other angered bishops were supported by Eudoxia. The empress resented his sermons contrasting gospel values with the excesses of imperial court life. Whether intended or not, sermons mentioning the lurid Jezebel and impious Herodias were associated with the empress, who finally did manage to have John exiled. He died in exile in 407.\nReflection\nJohn Chrysostom\u2019s preaching, by word and example, exemplifies the role of the prophet to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable. For his honesty and courage, he paid the price of a turbulent ministry as bishop, personal vilification, and exile.\nSaint John Chrysostom is the Patron Saint of:\nOrators\nPreachers\nSpeakers\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross\nEarly in the fourth century, Saint Helena, mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine, went to Jerusalem in search of the holy places of Christ\u2019s life. She razed the second-century Temple of Aphrodite, which tradition held was built over the Savior\u2019s tomb, and her son built the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher on that spot. During the excavation, workers found three crosses. Legend has it that the one on which Jesus died was identified when its touch healed a dying woman.\nThe cross immediately became an object of veneration. At a Good Friday celebration in Jerusalem toward the end of the fourth century, according to an eyewitness, the wood was taken out of its silver container and placed on a table together with the inscription Pilate ordered placed above Jesus\u2019 head: Then \u201call the people pass through one by one; all of them bow down, touching the cross and the inscription, first with their foreheads, then with their eyes; and, after kissing the cross, they move on.\u201d\nTo this day, the Eastern Churches, Catholic and Orthodox alike, celebrate the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on the September anniversary of the basilica\u2019s dedication. The feast entered the Western calendar in the seventh century after Emperor Heraclius recovered the cross from the Persians, who had carried it off in 614, 15 years earlier. According to the story, the emperor intended to carry the cross back into Jerusalem himself, but was unable to move forward until he took off his imperial garb and became a barefoot pilgrim.\nReflection\nThe cross is today the universal image of Christian belief. Countless generations of artists have turned it into a thing of beauty to be carried in procession or worn as jewelry. To the eyes of the first Christians, it had no beauty. It stood outside too many city walls, decorated only with decaying corpses, as a threat to anyone who defied Rome\u2019s authority\u2014including Christians who refused sacrifice to Roman gods. Although believers spoke of the cross as the instrument of salvation, it seldom appeared in Christian art unless disguised as an anchor or the Chi-Rho until after Constantine\u2019s edict of toleration.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of Our Lady of Sorrows\nFor a while there were two feasts in honor of the Sorrowful Mother: one going back to the 15th century, the other to the 17th century. For a while both were celebrated by the universal Church: one on the Friday before Palm Sunday, the other in September.\nThe principal biblical references to Mary\u2019s sorrows are in Luke 2:35 and John 19:26-27. The Lucan passage is Simeon\u2019s prediction about a sword piercing Mary\u2019s soul; the Johannine passage relates Jesus\u2019 words from the cross to Mary and to the beloved disciple.\nMany early Church writers interpret the sword as Mary\u2019s sorrows, especially as she saw Jesus die on the cross. Thus, the two passages are brought together as prediction and fulfillment.\nSaint\u00a0Ambrose in particular sees Mary as a sorrowful yet powerful figure at the cross. Mary stood fearlessly at the cross while others fled. Mary looked on her Son\u2019s wounds with pity, but saw in them the salvation of the world. As Jesus hung on the cross, Mary did not fear to be killed, but offered herself to her persecutors.\nReflection\nJohn\u2019s account of Jesus\u2019 death is highly symbolic. When Jesus gives the beloved disciple to Mary, we are invited to appreciate Mary\u2019s role in the Church: She symbolizes the Church; the beloved disciple represents all believers. As Mary mothered Jesus, she is now mother to all his followers. Furthermore, as Jesus died, he handed over his Spirit. Mary and the Spirit cooperate in begetting new children of God\u2014almost an echo of Luke\u2019s account of Jesus\u2019 conception. Christians can trust that they will continue to experience the caring presence of Mary and Jesus\u2019 Spirit throughout their lives and throughout history.\n",

During the interval, the Church was governed by a college of priests. Saint\u00a0Cyprian, a friend of Cornelius, writes that Cornelius was elected pope \u201cby the judgment of God and of Christ, by the testimony of most of the clergy, by the vote of the people, with the consent of aged priests and of good men.\u201d\nThe greatest problem of Cornelius\u2019s two-year term as pope had to do with the Sacrament of Penance and centered on the readmission of Christians who had denied their faith during the time of persecution. Two extremes were finally both condemned. Cyprian, primate of North Africa, appealed to the pope to confirm his stand that the relapsed could be reconciled only by the decision of the bishop.\nIn Rome, however, Cornelius met with the opposite view. After his election, a priest named Novatian (one of those who had governed the Church) had himself consecrated a rival bishop of Rome\u2014one of the first antipopes. He denied that the Church had any power to reconcile not only the apostates, but also those guilty of murder, adultery, fornication, or second marriage! Cornelius had the support of most of the Church (especially of Cyprian of Africa) in condemning Novatianism, though the sect persisted for several centuries. Cornelius held a synod at Rome in 251 and ordered the \u201crelapsed\u201d to be restored to the Church with the usual \u201cmedicines of repentance.\u201d\nThe friendship of Cornelius and Cyprian was strained for a time when one of Cyprian\u2019s rivals made accusations about him. But the problem was cleared up.\nA document from Cornelius shows the extent of organization in the Church of Rome in the mid-third century: 46 priests, seven deacons, seven subdeacons. It is estimated that the number of Christians totaled about 50,000. He died as a result of the hardships of his exile in what is now Civitavecchia.\nReflection\nIt seems fairly true to say that almost every possible false doctrine has been proposed at some time or other in the history of the Church. The third century saw the resolution of a problem we scarcely consider\u2014the penance to be done before reconciliation with the Church after mortal sin. Men like Cornelius and Cyprian were God\u2019s instruments in helping the Church find a prudent path between extremes of rigorism and laxity. They are part of the Church\u2019s ever-living stream of tradition, ensuring the continuance of what was begun by Christ, and evaluating new experiences through the wisdom and experience of those who have gone before.\n\u00a0",

A promising scholar from his youth in Tuscany, he devoted his energy to these two subjects, as well as to Scripture, in order to systematize Church doctrine against the attacks of the Protestant Reformers. He was the first Jesuit to become a professor at Louvain.\nHis most famous work is his three-volume Disputations on the Controversies of the Christian Faith. Particularly noteworthy are the sections on the temporal power of the pope and the role of the laity. Bellarmine incurred the anger of monarchists in England and France by showing the divine-right-of-kings theory untenable. He developed the theory of the indirect power of the pope in temporal affairs; although he was defending the pope against the Scottish philosopher Barclay, he also incurred the ire of Pope Sixtus V.\nBellarmine was made a cardinal by Pope Clement VIII on the grounds that \u201che had not his equal for learning.\u201d While he occupied apartments in the Vatican, Bellarmine relaxed none of his former austerities. He limited his household expenses to what was barely essential, eating only the food available to the poor. He was known to have ransomed a soldier who had deserted from the army and he used the hangings of his rooms to clothe poor people, remarking, \u201cThe walls won\u2019t catch cold.\u201d\nAmong many activities, Bellarmine became theologian to Pope Clement VIII, preparing two catechisms which have had great influence in the Church.\nThe last major controversy of Bellarmine\u2019s life came in 1616 when he had to admonish his friend Galileo, whom he admired. He delivered the admonition on behalf of the Holy Office, which had decided that the heliocentric theory of Copernicus was contrary to Scripture. The admonition amounted to a caution against putting forward\u2014other than as a hypothesis\u2014theories not yet fully proven. This shows that saints are not infallible.\nRobert Bellarmine died on September 17, 1621. The process for his canonization was begun in 1627, but was delayed until 1930 for political reasons, stemming from his writings. In 1930, Pope Pius XI canonized him, and the next year declared him a doctor of the Church.\nReflection\nThe renewal in the Church sought by Vatican II was difficult for many Catholics. In the course of change, many felt a lack of firm guidance from those in authority. They yearned for the stone columns of orthodoxy and an iron command with clearly defined lines of authority. Vatican II assures us in The Church in the Modern World, \u201cThere are many realities which do not change and which have their ultimate foundation in Christ, who is the same yesterday and today, yes, and forever\u201d (#10, quoting Hebrews 13:8).\nRobert Bellarmine devoted his life to the study of Scripture and Catholic doctrine. His writings help us understand that the real source of our faith is not merely a set of doctrines, but rather the person of Jesus still living in the Church today.\nSaint\u00a0Robert Bellarmine is the Patron Saint of:\nCatechists\nCatechumens\n\u00a0",

Following his baptism at the age of 15, Andrew traveled 1,300 miles to the seminary in Macao, China. After six years, he managed to return to his country through Manchuria. That same year he crossed the Yellow Sea to Shanghai and was ordained a priest. Back home again, he was assigned to arrange for more missionaries to enter by a water route that would elude the border patrol. He was arrested, tortured, and finally beheaded at the Han River near Seoul, the capital.\nAndrew\u2019s father Ignatius Kim, was martyred during the persecution of 1839, and was beatified in 1925. Paul Chong Hasang, a lay apostle and married man, also died in 1839 at age 45.\nAmong the other martyrs in 1839 was Columba Kim, an unmarried woman of 26. She was put in prison, pierced with hot tools and seared with burning coals. She and her sister Agnes were disrobed and kept for two days in a cell with condemned criminals, but were not molested. After Columba complained about the indignity, no more women were subjected to it. The two were beheaded. Peter Ryou, a\u00a0boy of 13, had his flesh so badly torn that he could pull off pieces and throw them at the judges. He was killed by strangulation. Protase Chong, a 41-year-old nobleman, apostatized under torture and was freed. Later he came back, confessed his faith and was tortured to death.\nChristianity came to Korea during the Japanese invasion in 1592 when some Koreans were baptized, probably by Christian Japanese soldiers. Evangelization was difficult because Korea refused all contact with the outside world except for taking taxes to Beijing annually. On one of these occasions, around 1777, Christian literature obtained from Jesuits in China led educated Korean Christians to study. A home Church began. When a Chinese priest managed to enter secretly a dozen years later, he found 4,000 Catholics, none of whom had ever seen a priest. Seven years later there were 10,000 Catholics. Religious freedom came to Korea in 1883.\nBesides Andrew and Paul, Pope John Paul II canonized 98 Koreans and three French missionaries who had been martyred between 1839 and 1867, when he visited Korea in 1984. Among them were bishops and priests, but for the most part they were lay persons: 47 women and 45 men.\nReflection\nWe marvel at the fact that the Korean Church was strictly a lay Church for a dozen years after its birth. How did the people survive without the Eucharist? It is no belittling of this and other sacraments to realize that there must be a living faith before there can be a truly beneficial celebration of the Eucharist. The sacraments are signs of God\u2019s initiative and response to faith already present. The sacraments increase grace and faith, but only if there is something ready to be increased.\n",

What business did the supposedly great teacher have associating with such immoral people? Jesus\u2019 answer was, \u201cThose who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. Go and learn the meaning of the words, \u2018I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\u2019 I did not come to call the righteous but sinners\u201d (Matthew 9:12b-13). Jesus is not setting aside ritual and worship; he is saying that loving others is even more important.\nNo other particular incidents about Matthew are found in the New Testament.\nReflection\nFrom such an unlikely situation, Jesus chose one of the foundations of the Church, a man others, judging from his job, thought was not holy enough for the position. But Matthew was honest enough to admit that he was one of the sinners Jesus came to call. He was open enough to recognize truth when he saw him. \u201cAnd he got up and followed him\u201d (Matthew 9:9b).\nSaint\u00a0Matthew is the Patron Saint of:\nAccountants\nActors\nBankers\nBookkeepers\nTax collectors\nTaxi Drivers\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint\u00a0Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions\u2019 Story\nLorenzo was born in Manila of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, both Christians. Thus he learned Chinese and Tagalog from them, and Spanish from the Dominicans whom he served as altar boy and sacristan. He became a professional calligrapher, transcribing documents in beautiful penmanship. He was a full member of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary under Dominican auspices. He married and had two sons and a daughter.\nLorenzo\u2019s life took an abrupt turn when he was accused of murder. Nothing further is known except the statement of two Dominicans that \u201che was sought by the authorities on account of a homicide to which he was present or which was attributed to him.\u201d\nAt that time, three Dominican priests, Antonio Gonzalez, Guillermo Courtet, and Miguel de Aozaraza, were about to sail to Japan in spite of a violent persecution there. With them was a Japanese priest, Vicente Shiwozuka de la Cruz, and a layman named Lazaro, a leper. Lorenzo, having taken asylum with them, was allowed to accompany them. But only when they were at sea did he learn that they were going to Japan.\nThey landed at Okinawa. Lorenzo could have gone on to Formosa, but, he reported, \u201cI decided to stay with the Fathers, because the Spaniards would hang me there.\u201d In Japan they were soon found out, arrested, and taken to Nagasaki. The site of wholesale bloodshed when the atomic bomb was dropped had known tragedy before. The 50,000 Catholics who once lived there were dispersed or killed by persecution.\nThey were subjected to an unspeakable kind of torture: After huge quantities of water were forced down their throats, they were made to lie down. Long boards were placed on their stomachs and guards then stepped on the ends of the boards, forcing the water to spurt violently from mouth, nose and ears.\nThe superior, Fr. Gonzalez, died after some days. Both Fr. Shiwozuka and Lazaro broke under torture, which included the insertion of bamboo needles under their fingernails. But both were brought back to courage by their companions.\nIn Lorenzo\u2019s moment of crisis, he asked the interpreter, \u201cI would like to know if, by apostatizing, they will spare my life.\u201d The interpreter was noncommittal, but in the ensuing hours Lorenzo felt his faith grow strong. He became bold, even audacious, with his interrogators.\nThe five were put to death by being hanged upside down in pits. Boards fitted with semi-circular holes were fitted around their waists and stones put on top to increase the pressure. They were tightly bound, to slow circulation and prevent a speedy death. They were allowed to hang for three days. By that time Lorenzo and Lazaro were dead. Still alive, the three priests were then beheaded.\nIn 1987, Pope\u00a0John Paul II canonized these six and 10 others: Asians and Europeans, men and women, who spread the faith in the Philippines, Formosa, and Japan. Lorenzo Ruiz is the first canonized Filipino martyr.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast of Saint\u00a0Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions is September 28.\nReflection\nWe ordinary Christians of today\u2014how would we stand up in the circumstances these martyrs faced? We sympathize with the two who temporarily denied the faith. We understand Lorenzo\u2019s terrible moment of temptation. But we see also the courage\u2014inexplainable in human terms\u2014which surged from their store of faith. Martyrdom, like ordinary life, is a miracle of grace.",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Pio of Pietrelcina\u2019s Story\nIn one of the largest such ceremonies in history, Pope John Paul II canonized Padre Pio of Pietrelcina on June 16, 2002. It was the 45th canonization ceremony in Pope John Paul\u2019s pontificate. More than 300,000 people braved blistering heat as they filled St. Peter\u2019s Square and nearby streets. They heard the Holy Father praise the new saint for his prayer and charity. \u201cThis is the most concrete synthesis of Padre Pio\u2019s teaching,\u201d said the pope. He also stressed Padre Pio\u2019s witness to the power of suffering. If accepted with love, the Holy Father stressed, such suffering can lead to \u201ca privileged path of sanctity.\u201d\nMany people have turned to the Italian Capuchin Franciscan to intercede with God on their behalf; among them was the future Pope John Paul II. In 1962, when he was still an archbishop in Poland, he wrote to Padre Pio and asked him to pray for a Polish woman with throat cancer. Within two weeks, she had been cured of her life-threatening disease.\nBorn Francesco Forgione, Padre Pio grew up in a family of farmers in southern Italy. Twice his father worked in Jamaica, New York, to provide the family income.\nAt the age of 15, Francesco joined the Capuchins and took the name of Pio. He was ordained in 1910 and was drafted during World War I. After he was discovered to have tuberculosis, he was discharged. In 1917, he was assigned to the friary in San Giovanni Rotondo, 75 miles from the city of Bari on the Adriatic.\nOn September 20, 1918, as he was making his thanksgiving after Mass, Padre Pio had a vision of Jesus. When the vision ended, he had the stigmata in his hands, feet, and side.\nLife became more complicated after that. Medical doctors, Church authorities, and curiosity seekers came to see Padre Pio. In 1924, and again in 1931, the authenticity of the stigmata was questioned; Padre Pio was not permitted to celebrate Mass publicly or to hear confessions. He did not complain of these decisions, which were soon reversed. However, he wrote no letters after 1924. His only other writing, a pamphlet on the agony of Jesus, was done before 1924.\nPadre Pio rarely left the friary after he received the stigmata, but busloads of people soon began coming to see him. Each morning after a 5 a.m. Mass in a crowded church, he heard confessions until noon. He took a mid-morning break to bless the sick and all who came to see him. Every afternoon he also heard confessions. In time his confessional ministry would take 10 hours a day; penitents had to take a number so that the situation could be handled. Many of them have said that Padre Pio knew details of their lives that they had never mentioned.\nPadre Pio saw Jesus in all the sick and suffering. At his urging, a fine hospital was built on nearby Mount Gargano. The idea arose in 1940; a committee began to collect money. Ground was broken in 1946. Building the hospital was a technical wonder because of the difficulty of getting water there and of hauling up the building supplies. This \u201cHouse for the Alleviation of Suffering\u201d has 350 beds.\nA number of people have reported cures they believe were received through the intercession of Padre Pio. Those who assisted at his Masses came away edified; several curiosity seekers were deeply moved. Like Saint\u00a0Francis, Padre Pio sometimes had his habit torn or cut by souvenir hunters.\nOne of Padre Pio\u2019s sufferings was that unscrupulous people several times circulated prophecies that they claimed originated from him. He never made prophecies about world events and never gave an opinion on matters that he felt belonged to Church authorities to decide. He died on September 23, 1968, and was beatified in 1999.\nReflection\nReferring to that day\u2019s Gospel (Matthew 11:25-30) at Padre Pio\u2019s canonization Mass in 2002, Saint John Paul II said: \u201cThe Gospel image of \u2018yoke\u2019 evokes the many trials that the humble Capuchin of San Giovanni Rotondo endured. Today we contemplate in him how sweet is the \u2018yoke\u2019 of Christ and indeed how light the burdens are whenever someone carries these with faithful love. The life and mission of Padre Pio testify that difficulties and sorrows, if accepted with love, transform themselves into a privileged journey of holiness, which opens the person toward a greater good, known only to the Lord.\u201d\n",

        "about": "Saint John Henry Newman\u2019s Story\nJohn Henry Newman, the 19th-century\u2019s most important English-speaking Roman Catholic theologian, spent the first half of his life as an Anglican and the second half as a Roman Catholic. He was a priest, popular preacher, writer, and eminent theologian in both churches.\nBorn in London, England, he studied at Oxford\u2019s Trinity College, was a tutor at Oriel College, and for 17 years was vicar of the university church, St. Mary the Virgin. He eventually published eight volumes of Parochial and Plain Sermons as well as two novels. His poem, \u201cDream of Gerontius,\u201d was set to music by Sir Edward Elgar.\nAfter 1833, Newman was a prominent member of the Oxford Movement, which emphasized the Church\u2019s debt to the Church Fathers and challenged any tendency to consider truth as completely subjective.\nHistorical research made Newman suspect that the Roman Catholic Church was in closest continuity with the Church that Jesus established. In 1845, he was received into full communion as a Catholic. Two years later he was ordained a Catholic priest in Rome and joined the Congregation of the Oratory, founded three centuries earlier by Saint\u00a0Philip Neri. Returning to England, Newman founded Oratory houses in Birmingham and London and for seven years served as rector of the Catholic University of Ireland.\nBefore Newman, Catholic theology tended to ignore history, preferring instead to draw deductions from first principles\u2014much as plane geometry does. After Newman, the lived experience of believers was recognized as a key part of theological reflection.\nNewman eventually wrote 40 books and 21,000 letters that survive. Most famous are his book-length Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine, Apologia Pro Vita Sua\u2014his spiritual autobiography up to 1864\u2014and Essay on the Grammar of Assent. He accepted Vatican I\u2019s teaching on papal infallibility while noting its limits, which many people who favored that definition were reluctant to do.\nWhen Newman was named a cardinal in 1879, he took as his motto \u201cCor ad cor loquitur\u201d\u2014\u201cHeart speaks to heart.\u201d He was buried in Rednal 11 years later. After his grave was exhumed in 2008, a new tomb was prepared at the Oratory church in Birmingham.\nThree years after Newman died, a Newman Club for Catholic students began at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In time, his name was linked to ministry centers at many public and private colleges and universities in the United States.\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI beatified Newman in London. Benedict noted Newman\u2019s emphasis on the vital place of revealed religion in civilized society, but also praised his pastoral zeal for the sick, the poor, the bereaved, and those in prison. Pope Francis canonized Newman in October 2019. Saint John Henry Newman\u2019s liturgical feast is October 9.\nReflection\nJohn Henry Newman has been called the \u201cabsent Father of Vatican II\u201d because his writings on conscience, religious liberty, Scripture, the vocation of lay people, the relation of Church and State, and other topics were extremely influential in the shaping of the Council\u2019s documents. Although Newman was not always understood or appreciated, he steadfastly preached the Good News by word and example.\nAnother Saint of the Day for September 24 is Saint Pacifico of San Severino.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Paul VI\u2019s Story\nBorn near Brescia in northern Italy, Giovanni Battista Montini was the second of three sons. His father, Giorgio, was a lawyer, editor, and eventually a member of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. His mother, Giuditta, was very involved in Catholic Action.\nAfter ordination in 1920, Giovanni did graduate studies in literature, philosophy, and canon law in Rome before he joined the Vatican Secretariat of State in 1924, where he worked for 30 years. He was also chaplain to the Federation of Italian Catholic University Students, where he met and became a very good friend of Aldo Moro, who eventually became prime minister. Moro was kidnapped by the Red Brigade in March 1978, and murdered two months later. A devastated Pope Paul VI presided at his funeral.\nIn 1954, Fr. Montini was named archbishop of Milan, where he sought to win disaffected workers back to the Catholic Church. He called himself the \u201carchbishop of the workers\u201d and visited factories regularly while overseeing the rebuilding of a local Church tremendously disrupted by World War II.\nIn 1958, Montini was the first of 23 cardinals named by Pope John XXIII, two months after the latter\u2019s election as pope. Cardinal Montini helped in preparing Vatican II and participated enthusiastically in its first sessions. When he was elected pope in June 1963, he immediately decided to continue that Council, which had another three sessions before its conclusion on December 8, 1965. The day before Vatican II concluded, Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras revoked the excommunications that their predecessors had made in 1054. The pope worked very hard to ensure that bishops would approve the Council\u2019s 16 documents by overwhelming majorities.\nPaul VI had stunned the world by visiting the Holy Land in January 1964, and meeting Athenagoras, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in person. The pope made eight more international trips, including one in 1965, to visit New York City and speak on behalf of peace before the United Nations General Assembly. He also visited India, Columbia, Uganda, and seven Asian countries during a 10-day tour in 1970.\nAlso in 1965, he instituted the World Synod of Bishops, and the next year decreed that bishops must offer their resignations on reaching age 75. In 1970, he decided that cardinals over 80 would no longer vote in papal conclaves or head the Holy See\u2019s major offices. He had increased the number of cardinals significantly, giving many countries their first cardinal. Eventually establishing diplomatic relations between the Holy See and 40 countries, he also instituted a permanent observer mission at the United Nations in 1964. Paul VI wrote seven encyclicals; his last one in 1968 on human life\u2014Humanae Vitae\u2014prohibited artificial birth control.\nPope Paul VI died at Castel Gandolfo on August 6, 1978, and was buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. He was beatified on October 19, 2014 and canonized on October 14, 2018.\nReflection\nSaint Pope Paul\u2019s greatest accomplishment was the completion and implementation of Vatican II. Its decisions about liturgy were the first ones noticed by most Catholics, but its other documents\u2014especially the ones about ecumenism, interfaith relations, divine revelation, religious liberty, the Church\u2019s self-understanding and the Church\u2019s work with the entire human family\u2014have become the Catholic Church\u2019s road map since 1965.\n",

This seems to have been a crucial moment in the life of the man from a small farm in Gascony, France, who had become a priest with little more ambition than to have a comfortable life.\nThe Countess de Gondi\u2014whose servant he had helped\u2014persuaded her husband to endow and support a group of able and zealous missionaries who would work among poor tenant farmers and country people in general. Vincent was too humble to accept leadership at first, but after working for some time in Paris among imprisoned galley slaves, he returned to be the leader of what is now known as the Congregation of the Mission, or the Vincentians. These priests, with vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability, were to devote themselves entirely to the people in smaller towns and villages.\nLater, Vincent established confraternities of charity for the spiritual and physical relief of the poor and sick of each parish. From these, with the help of Saint\u00a0Louise de Marillac, came the Daughters of Charity, \u201cwhose convent is the sickroom, whose chapel is the parish church, whose cloister is the streets of the city.\u201d He organized the rich women of Paris to collect funds for his missionary projects, founded several hospitals, collected relief funds for the victims of war, and ransomed over 1,200 galley slaves from North Africa. He was zealous in conducting retreats for clergy at a time when there was great laxity, abuse, and ignorance among them. He was a pioneer in clerical training and was instrumental in establishing seminaries.\nMost remarkably, Vincent was by temperament a very irascible person\u2014even his friends admitted it. He said that except for the grace of God he would have been \u201chard and repulsive, rough and cross.\u201d But he became a tender and affectionate man, very sensitive to the needs of others.\nPope Leo XIII made him the patron of all charitable societies. Outstanding among these, of course, is the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, founded in 1833 by his admirer Blessed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam.\nReflection\nThe Church is for all God\u2019s children, rich and poor, peasants and scholars, the sophisticated and the simple. But obviously the greatest concern of the Church must be for those who need the most help\u2014those made helpless by sickness, poverty, ignorance, or cruelty. Vincent de Paul is a particularly appropriate patron for all Christians today, when hunger has become starvation, and the high living of the rich stands in more and more glaring contrast to the physical and moral degradation in which many of God\u2019s children are forced to live.\nSaint Vincent de Paul is the Patron Saint of:\nCharitable Societies\n",

His saintly grandmother, Ludmilla, raised him and sought to promote him as ruler of Bohemia in place of his mother, who favored the anti-Christian factions. Ludmilla was eventually murdered, but rival Christian forces enabled Wenceslaus to assume leadership of the government.\nHis rule was marked by efforts toward unification within Bohemia, support of the Church, and peace-making negotiations with Germany, a policy which caused him trouble with the anti-Christian opposition. His brother Boleslav joined in the plotting, and in September of 929 invited Wenceslaus to Alt Bunglou for the celebration of the feast of Saints\u00a0Cosmas and Damian. On the way to Mass, Boleslav attacked his brother, and in the struggle, Wenceslaus was killed by supporters of Boleslav.\nAlthough his death resulted primarily from political upheaval, Wenceslaus was hailed as a martyr for the faith, and his tomb became a pilgrimage shrine. He is hailed as the patron of the Bohemian people and of the former Czechoslovakia.\nReflection\n\u201cGood King Wenceslaus\u201d was able to incarnate his Christianity in a world filled with political unrest. While we are often victims of violence of a different sort, we can easily identify with his struggle to bring harmony to society.

It is true that he had a very bad temper and could use a vitriolic pen, but his love for God and his son Jesus Christ was extraordinarily intense; anyone who taught error was an enemy of God and truth, and\u00a0Saint\u00a0Jerome went after him or her with his mighty and sometimes sarcastic pen.\nHe was above all a Scripture scholar, translating most of the Old Testament from the Hebrew. Jerome also wrote commentaries which are a great source of scriptural inspiration for us today. He was an avid student, a thorough scholar, a prodigious letter-writer and a consultant to monk, bishop, and pope. Saint\u00a0Augustine said of him, \u201cWhat Jerome is ignorant of, no mortal has ever known.\u201d\nSaint\u00a0Jerome is particularly important for having made a translation of the Bible which came to be called the Vulgate. It is not the most critical edition of the Bible, but its acceptance by the Church was fortunate. As a modern scholar says, \u201cNo man before Jerome or among his contemporaries and very few men for many centuries afterwards were so well qualified to do the work.\u201d The Council of Trent called for a new and corrected edition of the Vulgate, and declared it the authentic text to be used in the Church.\nIn order to be able to do such work, Jerome prepared himself well. He was a master of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldaic. He began his studies at his birthplace, Stridon in Dalmatia. After his preliminary education, he went to Rome, the center of learning at that time, and thence to Trier, Germany, where the scholar was very much in evidence. He spent several years in each place, always trying to find the very best teachers. He once served as private secretary to Pope Damasus.\nAfter these preparatory studies, he traveled extensively in Palestine, marking each spot of Christ\u2019s life with an outpouring of devotion. Mystic that he was, he spent five years in the desert of Chalcis so that he might give himself up to prayer, penance, and study. Finally, he settled in Bethlehem, where he lived in the cave believed to have been the birthplace of Christ. Jerome died in Bethlehem, and the remains of his body now lie buried in the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome.\nReflection\nJerome was a strong, outspoken man. He had the virtues and the unpleasant fruits of being a fearless critic and all the usual moral problems of a man. He was, as someone has said, no admirer of moderation whether in virtue or against evil. He was swift to anger, but also swift to feel remorse, even more severe on his own shortcomings than on those of others. A pope is said to have remarked, on seeing a picture of Jerome striking his breast with a stone, \u201cYou do well to carry that stone, for without it the Church would never have canonized you\u201d (Butler\u2019s Lives of the Saints).\nSaint Jerome is the patron Saint of:\nLibrarians\nTranslators\nScholars\n",

Corruption seemed to loom in every direction: the buying and selling of Church offices, violations of clerical celibacy, lay control of Church property, religious indifference and/or ignorance. After serving as bishop for two years, he\u2019d had his fill. He tried disappearing to a monastery, but the pope called him back to continue the work of reform.\nIronically, Hugh was reasonably effective in the role of reformer\u2014surely because of his devotion to the Church but also because of his strong character. In conflicts between Church and state he was an unflinching defender of the Church. He fearlessly supported the papacy. He was eloquent as a preacher. He restored his own cathedral, made civic improvements in the town, and weathered a brief exile.\nHugh may be best known as patron and benefactor of Saint\u00a0Bruno, founder of the Carthusian Order. He\u00a0died in 1132.

Before he was 20, he received the first followers who had come to imitate his way of life. Seventeen years later, when his disciples had grown in number, Francis established a Rule for his austere community and sought Church approval. This was the founding of the Hermits of St. Francis of Assisi, who were approved by the Holy See in 1474.\nIn 1492, Francis changed the name of his community to \u201cMinims\u201d because he wanted them to be known as the least (minimi) in the household of God. Humility was to be the hallmark of the brothers as it had been in Francis\u2019s personal life. Besides the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, Francis enjoined upon his followers the fourth obligation of a perpetual Lenten fast. He felt that heroic mortification was necessary as a means for spiritual growth.\nIt was Francis\u2019s desire to be a contemplative hermit, yet he believed that God was calling him to the apostolic life. He began to use the gifts he had received, such as the gifts of miracles and prophecy, to minister to the people of God. A defender of the poor and oppressed, Francis incurred the wrath of King Ferdinand of Naples for the admonitions he directed toward the king and his sons.\nFollowing the request of Pope Sixtus IV, Francis traveled to Paris to help Louis XI of France prepare for his death. While ministering to the king, Francis was able to influence the course of national politics. He helped to restore peace between France and Brittany by advising a marriage between the ruling families, and between France and Spain by persuading Louis XI to return some disputed land.\nFrancis died while at the French court.\nReflection\nThe life of Francis of Paola speaks plainly to an overactive world. He was a contemplative man called to active ministry and must have felt keenly the tension between prayer and service. Yet, in Francis\u2019s life it was a productive tension, for he clearly utilized the fruits of contemplation in his ministry, which came to involve the workings of nations. He responded so readily and so well to the call of the Church from a solid foundation in prayer and mortification. When he went out to the world, it was not he who worked but Christ working through him\u2014\u201cthe least in the household of God.\u201d\nSaint Francis of Paola is the Patron Saint\u00a0 of:\nSailors\nAnother Saint of the Day for April 2 is Blessed Elisabetta Vendramini.\n\u00a0",

Freed at 18, Benedict did farm work for a wage and soon saved enough to buy a pair of oxen. He was very proud of those animals. In time, he joined a group of hermits around Palermo and was eventually recognized as their leader. Because these hermits followed the Rule of Saint\u00a0Francis, Pope Pius IV ordered them to join the First Order.\nBenedict was eventually novice master and then guardian of the friars in Palermo\u2014positions rarely held in those days by a brother. In fact, Benedict was forced to accept his election as guardian. And when his term ended, he happily returned to his work in the friary kitchen.\nBenedict corrected the friars with humility and charity. Once he corrected a novice and assigned him a penance only to learn that the novice was not the guilty party. Benedict immediately knelt down before the novice and asked his pardon.\nIn later life, Benedict was not possessive of the few things he used. He never referred to them as \u201cmine,\u201d but always called them \u201cours.\u201d His gifts for prayer and the guidance of souls earned him throughout Sicily a reputation for holiness. Following the example of Saint Francis, Benedict kept seven 40-day fasts throughout the year; he also slept only a few hours each night.\nAfter Benedict\u2019s death, King Philip III of Spain paid for a special tomb for this holy friar. Canonized in 1807, he is honored as a patron saint by African Americans.\u00a0 The Liturgical Feast of Saint Benedict the African is April 4.\nReflection\nAmong Franciscans, a position of leadership is limited in time. When the time expires, former leaders sometimes have trouble adjusting to their new position. The Church needs men and women ready to put their best energies into leadership\u2014but also men and women who are gracefully willing to go on to other work when their time of leadership is over.\nSaint Benedict the African is the Patron Saint of:\nAfrican Americans\n",

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nSaint Isidore of Seville\u2019s Story\nThe 76 years of Isidore\u2019s life were a time of conflict and growth for the Church in Spain. The Visigoths had invaded the land a century and a half earlier, and shortly before Isidore\u2019s birth they set up their own capital. They were Arians\u2014Christians who said Christ was not God. Thus, Spain was split in two: One people (Catholic Romans) struggled with another (Arian Goths).\nIsidore reunited Spain, making it a center of culture and learning. The country served as a teacher and guide for other European countries whose culture was also threatened by barbarian invaders.\nBorn in Cartagena of a family that included three other sibling saints\u2014Leander, Fulgentius and Florentina\u2014he was educated by his elder brother, whom he succeeded as bishop of Seville.\nAn amazingly learned man, he was sometimes called \u201cThe Schoolmaster of the Middle Ages\u201d because the encyclopedia he wrote was used as a textbook for nine centuries. He required seminaries to be built in every diocese, wrote a Rule for religious orders, and founded schools that taught every branch of learning. Isidore wrote numerous books, including a dictionary, an encyclopedia, a history of Goths, and a history of the world\u2014beginning with creation! He completed the Mozarabic liturgy, which is still in use in Toledo, Spain. For all these reasons, Isidore has been suggested as patron of the Internet. Several others\u2014including Anthony of Padua\u2014also have been suggested.\nHe continued his austerities even as he approached age 80. During the last six months of his life, he increased his charities so much that his house was crowded from morning till night with the poor of the countryside.\nReflection\nOur society can well use Isidore\u2019s spirit of combining learning and holiness. Loving, understanding and knowledge can heal and bring a broken people back together. We are not barbarians like the invaders of Isidore\u2019s Spain. But people who are swamped by riches and overwhelmed by scientific and technological advances can lose much of their understanding love for one another.\nSaint Isidore of Seville is the Patron Saint of:\nInternet\nComputers\n",

If any saint is a patron of reconciliation, Vincent Ferrer is.\nDespite parental opposition, he entered the Dominican Order in his native Spain at 19. After brilliant studies, he was ordained a priest by Cardinal Peter de Luna\u2014who would figure tragically in his life.\nOf a very ardent nature, Vincent practiced the austerities of his Order with great energy. He was chosen prior of the Dominican house in Valencia shortly after his ordination.\nThe Western schism divided Christianity first between two, then three, popes. Clement VII lived at Avignon in France, Urban VI in Rome. Vincent was convinced the election of Urban was invalid, though Catherine of Siena was just as devoted a supporter of the Roman pope. In the service of Cardinal de Luna, Vincent worked to persuade Spaniards to follow Clement. When Clement died, Cardinal de Luna was elected at Avignon and became Benedict XIII.\nVincent worked for him as apostolic penitentiary and Master of the Sacred Palace. But the new pope did not resign as all candidates in the conclave had sworn to do. He remained stubborn, despite being deserted by the French king and nearly all of the cardinals.\nVincent became disillusioned and very ill, but finally took up the work of simply \u201cgoing through the world preaching Christ,\u201d though he felt that any renewal in the Church depended on healing the schism. An eloquent and fiery preacher, he spent the last 20 years of his life spreading the Good News in Spain, France, Switzerland, the Low Countries and Lombardy, stressing the need of repentance and the fear of coming judgment. He became known as the \u201cAngel of the Judgment.\u201d\nVincent tried unsuccessfully, in 1408 and 1415, to persuade his former friend to resign. He finally concluded that Benedict was not the true pope. Though very ill, he mounted the pulpit before an assembly over which Benedict himself was presiding, and thundered his denunciation of the man who had ordained him a priest. Benedict fled for his life, abandoned by those who had formerly supported him. Strangely, Vincent had no part in the Council of Constance, which ended the schism.\nReflection\nThe split in the Church at the time of Vincent Ferrer should have been fatal\u201436 long years of having two \u201cheads.\u201d We cannot imagine what condition the Church today would be in if, for that length of time, half the world had followed a succession of popes in Rome, and half an equally \u201cofficial\u201d number of popes in say, Rio de Janeiro. It is an ongoing miracle that the Church has not long since been shipwrecked on the rocks of pride and ignorance, greed and ambition. Contrary to Lowell\u2019s words, \u201cTruth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne,\u201d we believe that \u201ctruth is mighty, and it shall prevail\u201d\u2014but it sometimes takes a long time.\nSaint Vincent Ferrer is the Patron Saint of:\nBuilders\nBusinessmen\nReconciliation\n",

She spent play time praying in the parish church, assisted those even poorer than herself and had so mastered the truths of her religion that she was permitted to make her first Holy Communion at the then unusually early age of 7. In the town she was called \u201cthe little angel.\u201d\nAs she grew older, she desired to enter the convent of the Tertiaries of Saint Francis. But the convent was poor, and because Crescentia had no dowry, the superiors refused her admission. Her case was then pleaded by the Protestant mayor of the town to whom the convent owed a favor. The community felt it was forced into receiving her, and her new life was made miserable. She was considered a burden and assigned nothing other than menial tasks. Even her cheerful spirit was misinterpreted as flattery or hypocrisy.\nConditions improved four years later when a new superior was elected who realized her virtue. Crescentia herself was appointed mistress of novices. She so won the love and respect of the sisters that, upon the death of the superior, Crescentia was unanimously elected to that position. Under her, the financial state of the convent improved and her reputation in spiritual matters spread. She was soon being consulted by princes and princesses; bishops and cardinals too sought her advice. And yet, a true daughter of Francis, she remained ever humble.\nBodily afflictions and pain were always with her. First it was headaches and toothaches. Then she lost the ability to walk, her hands and feet gradually becoming so crippled that her body curled up into a fetal position. In the spirit of Francis she cried out, \u201cOh, you bodily members, praise God that he has given you the capacity to suffer.\u201d Despite her sufferings she was filled with peace and joy as she died on Easter Sunday in 1744.\nShe was beatified in 1900 and canonized by Pope John Paul II in 2001.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast Day for Saint Crescentia Hoess is April 5.\nReflection\nAlthough she grew up in poverty and willingly embraced it in her vocation, Crescentia had a good head for business. Under her able administration, her convent regained financial stability. Too often, we think of good money management as, at best, a less-than-holy gift. But Crescentia was wise enough to balance her worldly skills with such acumen in spiritual matters that heads of State and Church both sought her advice.\n",

In 1950, Pope Pius XII named him patron of schoolteachers for his efforts in upgrading school instruction. As a young 17th-century Frenchman, John had everything going for him: scholarly bent, good looks, noble family background, money, refined upbringing. At the early age of 11, he received the tonsure and started preparation for the priesthood, to which he was ordained at 27. He seemed assured then of a life of dignified ease and a high position in the Church.\nBut God had other plans for John, which were gradually revealed to him in the next several years. During a chance meeting with Monsieur Adrien Nyel, he became interested in the creation of schools for poor boys in Rheims, where he was stationed. Though the work was extremely distasteful to him at first, he became more involved in working with the deprived youths.\nOnce convinced that this was his divinely appointed mission, John threw himself wholeheartedly into the work, left home and family, abandoned his position as canon at Rheims, gave away his fortune, and reduced himself to the level of the poor to whom he devoted his entire life.\nThe remainder of his life was closely entwined with the community of religious men he founded, the Brothers of the Christian School (also called Christian Brothers or De La Salle Brothers). This community grew rapidly and was successful in educating boys of poor families, using methods designed by John. It prepared teachers in the first training college for teachers and also set up homes and schools for young delinquents of wealthy families. The motivating element in all these endeavors was the desire to become a good Christian.\nYet even in his success, John did not escape experiencing many trials: heart-rending disappointment and defections among his disciples,\u00a0bitter opposition from the secular schoolmasters who resented his new and fruitful methods, and persistent opposition from the Jansenists of his time, whose moral rigidity and pessimism about the human condition John resisted vehemently all his life.\nAfflicted with asthma and rheumatism in his last years, he died at age 68 on Good Friday, and was canonized in 1900.\nReflection\nComplete dedication to one\u2019s calling by God, whatever it may be, is a rare quality. Jesus asks us to \u201clove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength\u201d (Mark 12:30b, emphasis added).

Though the first years of her life were relatively peaceful and uncomplicated, Julie had to take up manual work as a young teen when her family lost its money. However, she spent her spare time teaching catechism to young people and to the farm laborers.\nA mysterious illness overtook her when she was about 30. Witnessing an attempt to wound or even kill her father, Julie was paralyzed and became a complete invalid. For the next two decades, she continued to teach catechism lessons from her bed, offered spiritual advice, and attracted visitors who had heard of her holiness.\nWhen the French Revolution broke out in 1789, revolutionary forces became aware of her allegiance to fugitive priests. With the help of friends, she was smuggled out of Cuvilly in a haycart. She then spent several years hiding in Compiegne, being moved from house to house despite her growing physical pain. She even lost the power of speech for a time.\nBut this period also proved to be a fruitful spiritual time for Julie. It was at this time she had a vision in which she saw Calvary surrounded by women in religious habits and heard a voice saying, \u201cBehold these spiritual daughters whom I give you in an institute marked by the cross.\u201d\nAs time passed and Julie continued her mobile life, she made the acquaintance of an aristocratic woman, Fran\u00e7oise Blin de Bourdon, who shared Julie\u2019s interest in teaching the faith. In 1803, the two women began the Institute of Notre Dame, which was dedicated to the education of the poor, young Christian girls, and the training of catechists. The following year, the first Sisters of Notre Dame made their vows. That was the same year that Julie recovered from the illness: She was able to walk for the first time in 22 years.\nThough Julie had always been attentive to the special needs of the poor and that always remained her priority, she also became aware that other classes in society needed Christian instruction. From the founding of the Sisters of Notre Dame until her death, Julie was on the road, opening a variety of schools in France and Belgium that served the poor and the wealthy, vocational groups, teachers. Ultimately, Julie and Fran\u00e7oise moved the motherhouse to Namur, Belgium.\nJulie died there in 1816. She was canonized in 1969.\nReflection\nJulie\u2019s immobility in no way impeded her activities. In spite of her suffering, she managed to co-found a teaching order that tended to the needs of both the poor and the well-to-do. Each of us has limitations, but the worst malady any of us can suffer is the spiritual paralysis that keeps us from doing God\u2019s work on earth.\n\n",

Her death likely occurred around the year 1050.\nReflection\nTensions between Muslims and Christians have often existed throughout history, sometimes resulting in bloody conflict.

He is remembered with Saints Thomas More and Thomas Becket for vigorous opposition to the evils of an unjust government.\nBorn in Szczepanow near Krak\u00f3w on July 26, 1030, he was ordained a priest after being educated in the cathedral schools of Gniezno, then capital of Poland, and at Paris. He was appointed preacher and archdeacon to the bishop of Krak\u00f3w, where his eloquence and example brought about real conversion in many of his penitents, both clergy and laity. He became bishop of Krak\u00f3w in 1072.\nDuring an expedition against the Grand Duchy of Kiev, Stanislaus became involved in the political situation of Poland. Known for his outspokenness, he aimed his attacks at the evils of the peasantry and the king, especially the unjust wars and immoral acts of King Boleslaus II.\nThe king first excused himself, then made a show of penance, then relapsed into his old ways. Stanislaus continued his open opposition in spite of charges of treason and threats of death, finally excommunicating the king. Enraged, the latter ordered soldiers to kill the bishop. When they refused, the king killed Stanislaus with his own hands.\nForced to flee to Hungary, Boleslaus supposedly spent the rest of his life as a penitent in the Benedictine abbey in Osiak.\nReflection\nSaints John the Baptist, Thomas Becket, Thomas More, and Stanislaus are a few of the prophets who dared to denounce corruption in high places. They followed in the footsteps of Jesus himself, who pointed out the moral corruption in the religious leadership of his day.

The experience deepened her desire to serve God and clarified the path she would follow. At age 19 Juana became a Carmelite nun, taking the name of Teresa.\nThe convent offered the simple lifestyle Teresa desired and the joy of living in a community of women completely devoted to God.

At age 20 she contracted typhus and quickly took her final vows. She died a short time later, during Holy Week.\nKnown as the \u201cFlower of the Andes,\u201d Teresa remains popular with the estimated 100,000 pilgrims who visit her shrine in Los Andes each year.

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Martin I\u2019s Story\nWhen Martin I became pope in 649, Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine empire and the patriarch of Constantinople was the most influential Church leader in the eastern Christian world. The struggles that existed within the Church at that time were magnified by the close cooperation of emperor and patriarch.\nA teaching, strongly supported in the East, held that Christ had no human will. Twice, emperors had officially favored this position: Heraclius by publishing a formula of faith, and Constans II by silencing the issue of one or two wills in Christ.\nShortly after assuming the office of the papacy\u2014which he did without first being confirmed by the emperor\u2014Martin held a council at the Lateran in which the imperial documents were censured, and in which the patriarch of Constantinople and two of his predecessors were condemned. In response, Constans II first tried to turn bishops and people against the pope.\nFailing in this and in an attempt to kill the pope, the emperor sent troops to Rome to seize Martin and to bring him back to Constantinople. Already in poor health, Martin offered no resistance, returned with Calliopas, the exarch of Constantinople, and was then submitted to various imprisonments, tortures, and hardships. Although condemned to death and with some of the imposed torture already carried out, Martin was saved from execution by the pleas of a repentant Paul, patriarch of Constantinople, who was himself gravely ill.\nTortures and cruel treatment having taken their toll, Martin died shortly thereafter. He is the last of the early popes to be venerated as a martyr.\nReflection\nThe real significance of the word martyr comes not from the dying but from the witnessing, which the word means in its derivation. People who are willing to give up everything, their most precious possessions, their very lives, put a supreme value on the cause or belief for which they sacrifice. Martyrdom, dying for the faith, is an incidental extreme to which some have had to go to manifest their belief in Christ. A living faith, a life that exemplifies Christ\u2019s teaching throughout, and that in spite of difficulties, is required of all Christians. Martin refused to cut corners as a way of easing his lot, to make some accommodations with the civil rulers.\n",

He was confident he had made the right choice. That was until he saw firsthand the realities of battle, including the Saint Bartholomew\u2019s Day massacres of French Protestants in 1572.\nHe fell seriously ill and found himself reviewing his priorities, including his spiritual life. By the time he had recovered, Caesar had resolved to become a priest. Following his ordination in 1582, he undertook special pastoral work: teaching the catechism to ordinary people living in neglected, rural, out-of-the-way places. His efforts were badly needed and well received.\nWorking with his cousin, Caesar developed a program of family catechesis. The goal\u2014to ward off heresy among the people\u2014met the approval of local bishops. Out of these efforts grew a new religious congregation: the Fathers of Christian Doctrine.\nOne of Caesar\u2019s works, Instructions for the Family on the Four Parts of the Roman Catechism, was published 60 years after his death.\nHe was beatified in 1975.\nReflection\n\u201cFamily catechesis\u201d is a familiar term in parish life today.

The family was living in the basement of a dilapidated building when on February 11, 1858, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette in a cave above the banks of the Gave River near Lourdes. Bernadette, 14 years old, was known as a virtuous girl though a dull student who had not even made her first Holy Communion. In poor health, she had suffered from asthma from an early age.\nThere were 18 appearances in all, the final one occurring on the feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, July 16. Although Bernadette\u2019s initial reports provoked skepticism, her daily visions of \u201cthe Lady\u201d brought great crowds of the curious. The Lady, Bernadette explained, had instructed her to have a chapel built on the spot of the visions. There, the people were to come to wash in and drink of the water of the spring that had welled up from the very spot where Bernadette had been instructed to dig.\nAccording to Bernadette, the Lady of her visions was a girl of 16 or 17 who wore a white robe with a blue sash. Yellow roses covered her feet, a large rosary was on her right arm. In the vision on March 25 she told Bernadette, \u201cI am the Immaculate Conception.\u201d It was only when the words were explained to her that Bernadette came to realize who the Lady was.\nFew visions have ever undergone the scrutiny that these appearances of the Immaculate Virgin were subject to. Lourdes became one of the most popular Marian shrines in the world, attracting millions of visitors. Miracles were reported at the shrine and in the waters of the spring. After thorough investigation, Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862.\nDuring her life, Bernadette suffered much. She was hounded by the public as well as by civic officials until at last she was protected in a convent of nuns. Five years later, she petitioned to enter the Sisters of Notre Dame of Nevers. After a period of illness she was able to make the journey from Lourdes and enter the novitiate. But within four months of her arrival she was given the last rites of the Church and allowed to profess her vows. She recovered enough to become infirmarian and then sacristan, but chronic health problems persisted. She died on April 16, 1879, at the age of 35.\nBernadette Soubirous was canonized in 1933.\nReflection\nMillions of people have come to the spring Bernadette uncovered for healing of body and spirit, but she found no relief from ill health there.

He wore the rags of a beggar and shared his food with the poor. Filled with the love of God and neighbor, Benedict had special devotion to the Blessed Mother and to the Blessed Sacrament.

In those days, this region was recovering from the Napoleonic wars. A lover of solitary prayer and a peacemaker as a young man, Conrad joined the Capuchins as a brother. He made his profession in 1852 and was assigned to the friary in Altoetting. That city\u2019s shrine to Mary was very popular; at the nearby Capuchin friary there was a lot of work for the porter, a job Conrad held for 41 years.\nAt first, some of the other friars were jealous that such a young friar held this important job. Conrad\u2019s patience and holy life overcame their doubts. As porter, he dealt with many people, obtaining many of the friary supplies and generously providing for the poor who came to the door. He treated them all with the courtesy Francis expected of his followers.\nConrad\u2019s helpfulness was sometimes unnerving.

Twelve years later, after careless disinterest in religion and years of worldly living, he finally fulfilled his desire to be a monk. He entered the monastery of Bec in Normandy, was elected prior three years later, and 15 years later, was unanimously chosen abbot.\nConsidered an original and independent thinker, Anselm was admired for his patience, gentleness, and teaching skill. Under his leadership, the Abbey of Bec became a monastic school, influential in philosophical and theological studies.\nDuring these years, at the community\u2019s request, Anselm began publishing his theological works, comparable to those of Saint Augustine. His best-known work is the book Cur Deus Homo (\u201cWhy God Became Man\u201d).\nAgainst his will, Anselm was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1093, at age 60.

Within a short time, however, he was exiled again after excommunicating those who violated the right of sanctuary by dragging a woman accused of adultery from a church and murdering her.\nAfter a short ministry in Hungary, he went to preach the Good News to people living near the Baltic Sea. He and two companions were martyred by pagan priests in that region. Adalbert\u2019s body was immediately ransomed and buried in the Gniezno, Poland, cathedral. In the mid-11th century his relics were moved to Saint\u00a0Vitus Cathedral in Prague.\u00a0His Liturgical Feast day is April 23.\nReflection\nPreaching the Good News can be dangerous work whether the audience is already baptized or not. Adalbert fearlessly preached Jesus\u2019 gospel and received a martyr\u2019s crown for his efforts. Similar zeal has created modern martyrs in many places, especially in Central and South America. Some of those martyrs grew up in areas once evangelized by Adalbert.\n",

There is every reason to believe that he was a real martyr who suffered at Lydda in Palestine, probably before the time of Constantine. The Church adheres to his memory, but not to the legends surrounding his life. That he was willing to pay the supreme price to follow Christ is what the Church believes. And it is enough.\nThe story of George\u2019s slaying the dragon, rescuing the king\u2019s daughter, and converting Libya is a 12th-century Italian fable. George was a favorite patron saint of crusaders, as well as of Eastern soldiers in earlier times. He is a patron saint of England, Portugal, Germany, Aragon, Catalonia, Genoa, Milan and Bologna.\nReflection\nHuman nature seems to crave more than cold historical data. Americans have Washington and Lincoln, but we somehow need Paul Bunyan, too. The life of Saint Francis of Assisi is inspiring enough, but for centuries the Italians have found his spirit in the legends of the Fioretti, too. Santa Claus is the popular extension of the spirit of Saint Nicholas. The legends about Saint George are part of this yearning. Both fact and legend are human ways of illumining the mysterious truth about the One who alone is holy.\nSaint George is the Patron Saint of:\nBoy Scouts\nEngland\nPortugal\nSoldiers\nGermany\n",

Complete generosity to others characterized this saint\u2019s life.\nBorn in 1577, Mark Rey became a lawyer who constantly upheld the causes of the poor and oppressed people. Nicknamed \u201cthe poor man\u2019s lawyer,\u201d Rey soon grew disgusted with the corruption and injustice he saw among his colleagues. He left his law career to become a priest, joining his brother George as a member of the Capuchin Order. Fidelis was his religious name. His wealth was divided between needy seminarians and the poor.\nAs a follower of Saint Francis of Assisi, Fidelis continued his devotion to the weak and needy. During a severe epidemic in a city where he was guardian of a friary, Fidelis cared for and cured many sick soldiers.\nHe was appointed head of a group of Capuchins sent to preach against the Calvinists and Zwinglians in Switzerland. Almost certain violence threatened. Those who observed the mission felt that success was more attributable to the prayer of Fidelis during the night than to his sermons and instructions.\nHe was accused of opposing the peasants\u2019 national aspirations for independence from Austria. While he was preaching at Seewis, to which he had gone against the advice of his friends, a gun was fired at him, but he escaped unharmed. A Protestant offered to shelter Fidelis, but he declined, saying his life was in God\u2019s hands. On the road back, he was set upon by a group of armed men and killed.\nFidelis was canonized in 1746. Fifteen years later he was recognized as a martyr.\nReflection\nFidelis\u2019 constant prayer was that he be kept completely faithful to God and not give in to any lukewarmness or apathy. He was often heard to exclaim, \u201cWoe to me if I should prove myself but a halfhearted soldier in the service of my thorn-crowned Captain.\u201d His prayer against apathy, and his concern for the poor and weak make him a saint whose example is valuable today. The modern Church is calling us to follow the example of \u201cthe poor man\u2019s lawyer\u201d by sharing ourselves and our talents with those less fortunate and by working for justice in the world.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Mark\u2019s Story\nMost of what we know about Mark comes directly from the New Testament. He is usually identified with the Mark of Acts 12:12. When Saint Peter escaped from prison, he went to the home of Mark\u2019s mother.\nPaul and Barnabas took him along on the first missionary journey, but for some reason Mark returned alone to Jerusalem. It is evident, from Paul\u2019s refusal to let Mark accompany him on the second journey despite Barnabas\u2019s insistence, that Mark had displeased Paul. Because Paul later asks Mark to visit him in prison, we may assume the trouble did not last long.\nThe oldest and the shortest of the four Gospels, the Gospel of Mark emphasizes Jesus\u2019s rejection by humanity while being God\u2019s triumphant envoy. Probably written for gentile converts in Rome\u2014after the death of Peter and Paul sometime between A.D. 60 and 70\u2014Mark\u2019s Gospel is the gradual manifestation of a \u201cscandal\u201d: a crucified Messiah.\nEvidently a friend of Mark\u2014calling him \u201cmy son\u201d\u2014Peter is only one of this\u00a0Gospel\u2019s sources, others being the Church in Jerusalem (Jewish roots), and the Church at Antioch (largely gentile).\nLike another Gospel writer Luke, Mark was not one of the 12 apostles. We cannot be certain whether he knew Jesus personally. Some scholars feel that the evangelist is speaking of himself when describing the arrest of Jesus in Gethsemane: \u201cNow a young man followed him wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They seized him, but he left the cloth behind and ran off naked\u201d (Mark 14:51-52).\nOthers hold Mark to be the first bishop of Alexandria, Egypt. Venice, famous for the Piazza San Marco, claims Mark as its patron saint; the large basilica there is believed to contain his remains.\nA winged lion is Mark\u2019s symbol. The lion derives from Mark\u2019s description of John the Baptist as a \u201cvoice of one crying out in the desert\u201d (Mark 1:3), which artists compared to a roaring lion. The wings come from the application of Ezekiel\u2019s vision of four winged creatures to the evangelists.\nReflection\nMark fulfilled in his life what every Christian is called to do: proclaim to all people the Good News that is the source of salvation. In particular, Mark\u2019s way was by writing. Others may proclaim the Good News by music, drama, poetry, or by teaching children around a family table.\nSaint Mark is the Patron Saint of:\nNotaries\n",

Known as the \u201cSaint Francis of the Americas,\u201d Pedro de Betancur is the first saint to have worked and died in Guatemala.\nPedro very much wanted to become a priest, but God had other plans for the young man born into a poor family on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Pedro was a shepherd until age 24, when he began to make his way to Guatemala, hoping to connect with a relative engaged in government service there. By the time he reached Havana, he was out of money. After working there to earn more, he got to Guatemala City the following year. When he arrived, he was so destitute that he joined the breadline that the Franciscans had established.\nSoon, Pedro enrolled in the local Jesuit college in hopes of studying for the priesthood. No matter how hard he tried, however, he could not master the material; he withdrew from school. In 1655, he joined the Secular Franciscan Order. Three years later, he opened a hospital for the convalescent poor; a shelter for the homeless, and a school for the poor soon followed. Not wanting to neglect the rich of Guatemala City, Pedro began walking through their part of town ringing a bell and inviting them to repent.\nOther men came to share in Pedro\u2019s work. Out of this group came the Bethlehemite Congregation, which won papal approval after Pedro\u2019s death. A Bethlehemite sisters\u2019 community, similarly founded after Pedro\u2019s death, was inspired by his life of prayer and compassion.\nHe is sometimes credited with originating the Christmas Eve posadas procession in which people representing Mary and Joseph seek a night\u2019s lodging from their neighbors. The custom soon spread to Mexico and other Central American countries.\nPedro died in 1667, and was canonized by Pope John Paul II in Guatemala City on July 30, 2002.\nCalling the new saint an \u201coutstanding example\u201d of Christian mercy, the Holy Father noted that Saint Pedro practiced mercy \u201cheroically with the lowliest and the most deprived.\u201d Speaking to the estimated 500,000 Guatemalans in attendance, the Holy Father spoke of the social ills that plague the country today and of the need for change.\n\u201cLet us think of the children and young people who are homeless or deprived of an education; of abandoned women with their many needs; of the hordes of social outcasts who live in the cities; of the victims of organized crime, of prostitution or of drugs; of the sick who are neglected and the elderly who live in loneliness,\u201d he said in his homily during the three-hour liturgy.\nAs humans, we often pride ourselves on our ability to reason. But as Pedro\u2019s life shows, other skills may be an even more crucial element of our humanity than a clever mind: compassion, imagination, love. Unable to master studies for the priesthood despite his efforts, Pedro responded to the needs of homeless and sick people; he provided education to the poor and salvation to the rich. He became holy\u2014as fully human as any of us can ever be.\n\u00a0",

Totus tuus (\u201ccompletely yours\u201d) was Louis\u2019s personal motto; Pope John Paul II chose it as his episcopal motto.\nBorn in the Breton village of Montfort, close to Rennes, France, as an adult Louis identified himself by the place of his Baptism instead of his family name, Grignion. After being educated by the Jesuits and the Sulpicians, he was ordained a diocesan priest in 1700.\nSoon he began preaching parish missions throughout western France. His years of ministering to the poor prompted him to travel and live very simply, sometimes getting him into trouble with Church authorities. In his preaching, which attracted thousands of people back to the faith, Father Louis recommended frequent, even daily, Holy Communion\u2014not the custom then!\u2014and imitation of the Virgin Mary\u2019s ongoing acceptance of God\u2019s will for her life.\nLouis founded the Missionaries of the Company of Mary, for priests and brothers, and the Daughters of Wisdom, who cared especially for the sick. His book True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin has become a classic explanation of Marian devotion.\nLouis died in Saint-Laurent-sur-S\u00e8vre, where a basilica has been erected in his honor. He was canonized in 1947.\u00a0His Liturgical Feast Day is April 28.\nReflection\nLike Mary, Louis experienced challenges in his efforts to follow Jesus. Opposed at times in his preaching and in his other ministries, Louis knew with Saint Paul, \u201cNeither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:7). Any attempt to succeed by worldly standards runs the risk of betraying the Good News of Jesus. Mary is \u201cthe first and most perfect disciple,\u201d as the late Sulpician Father Raymond Brown described her.\nAnother Saint of the Day for April 27 is Saint Zita of Lucca.\n\u00a0",

As a young priest, Peter revived a parish in a \u201cbad\u201d district by the simple method of showing great devotion to the sick. Wanting to be a missionary, he joined the Society of Mary, the Marists, at 28. Obediently, he taught in the seminary for five years. Then, as superior of seven Marists, he traveled to Western Oceania. The bishop accompanying the missionaries left Peter and a brother on Futuna Island northeast of Fiji, promising to return in six months. He was gone five years.\nMeanwhile, Peter struggled with this new language and mastered it, making the difficult adjustment to life with whalers, traders, and warring natives. Despite little apparent success and severe want, he maintained a serene and gentle spirit, plus endless patience and courage. A few natives had been baptized, a few more were being instructed. When the chieftain\u2019s son asked to be baptized, persecution by the chieftain reached a climax. Father Chanel was clubbed to death.\nWithin two years after his death, the whole island became Catholic and has remained so. He was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1954. Peter Chanel is the first martyr of Oceania and its patron.\nReflection\nSuffering for Christ means suffering because we are like Christ. Very often the opposition we meet is the result of our own selfishness or imprudence. We are not martyrs when we are \u201cpersecuted\u201d by those who merely treat us as we treat them.

What is most impressive about her is that she learns to view her surrender to her Lord as a goal to be reached through time.\nShe was the 23rd child of Jacopo and Lapa Benincasa and grew up as an intelligent, cheerful, and intensely religious person. Catherine disappointed her mother by cutting off her hair as a protest against being overly encouraged to improve her appearance in order to attract a husband. Her father ordered her to be left in peace, and she was given a room of her own for prayer and meditation.\nShe entered the Dominican Third Order at 18 and spent the next three years in seclusion, prayer, and austerity. Gradually, a group of followers gathered around her\u2014men and women, priests and religious. An active public apostolate grew out of her contemplative life. Her letters, mostly for spiritual instruction and encouragement of her followers, began to take more and more note of public affairs. Opposition and slander resulted from her mixing fearlessly with the world and speaking with the candor and authority of one completely committed to Christ. She was cleared of all charges at the Dominican General Chapter of 1374.\nHer public influence reached great heights because of her evident holiness, her membership in the Dominican Third Order, and the deep impression she made on the pope. She worked tirelessly for the crusade against the Turks and for peace between Florence and the pope.\nIn 1378, the Great Schism began, splitting the allegiance of Christendom between two, then three, popes and putting even saints on opposing sides. Catherine spent the last two years of her life in Rome, in prayer and pleading on behalf of the cause of Pope Urban VI and the unity of the Church. She offered herself as a victim for the Church in its agony. She died surrounded by her \u201cchildren\u201d and was canonized in 1461.\nCatherine ranks high among the mystics and spiritual writers of the Church. In 1939, she and Francis of Assisi were declared co-patrons of Italy. Pope Paul VI named her and Teresa of Avila doctors of the Church in 1970. Her spiritual testament is found in The Dialogue.\nReflection\nThough she lived her life in a faith experience and spirituality far different from that of our own time, Catherine of Siena stands as a companion with us on the Christian journey in her undivided effort to invite the Lord to take flesh in her own life. Events which might make us wince or chuckle or even yawn fill her biographies: a mystical experience at six, childhood betrothal to Christ, stories of harsh asceticism, her frequent ecstatic visions. Still, Catherine lived in an age which did not know the rapid change of 21st-century mobile America. The value of her life for us today lies in her recognition of holiness as a goal to be sought over the course of a lifetime.\nSaint Catherine of Siena is the Patron Saint of:\nEurope\nFire Prevention\nItaly\n\n",

If we think popes had difficulties in implementing Vatican Council II, Pius V had even greater problems after Trent four centuries earlier.\nDuring his papacy (1566-1572), Pius V was faced with the almost overwhelming responsibility of getting a shattered and scattered Church back on its feet. The family of God had been shaken by corruption, by the Reformation, by the constant threat of Turkish invasion, and by the bloody bickering of the young nation-states. In 1545, a previous pope convened the Council of Trent in an attempt to deal with all these pressing problems. Off and on over 18 years, the Fathers of the Church discussed, condemned, affirmed, and decided upon a course of action. The Council closed in 1563.\nPius V was elected in 1566 and charged with the task of implementing the sweeping reforms called for by the Council. He ordered the founding of seminaries for the proper training of priests. He published a new missal, a new breviary, a new catechism, and established the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine classes for the young. Pius zealously enforced legislation against abuses in the Church. He patiently served the sick and the poor by building hospitals, providing food for the hungry, and giving money customarily used for the papal banquets to poor Roman converts. His decision to keep wearing his Dominican habit led to the custom\u2013to this day\u2013of the pope wearing a white cassock.\nIn striving to reform both Church and state, Pius encountered vehement opposition from England\u2019s Queen Elizabeth and the Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Problems in France and in the Netherlands also hindered Pius\u2019s hopes for a Europe united against the Turks. Only at the last minute was he able to organize a fleet which won a decisive victory in the Gulf of Lepanto, off Greece, on October 7, 1571.\nPius\u2019s ceaseless papal quest for a renewal of the Church was grounded in his personal life as a Dominican friar. He spent long hours with his God in prayer, fasted rigorously, deprived himself of many customary papal luxuries, and faithfully observed the spirit of the Dominican Rule that he had professed.\nReflection\nIn their personal lives and in their actions as popes, Saint Pius V and Saint Paul VI both led the family of God in the process of interiorizing and implementing the new birth called for by the Spirit in major Councils. With zeal and patience, Pius and Paul pursued the changes urged by the Council Fathers. Like Pius and Paul, we too are called to constant change of heart and life.\nAnother Saint of the Day for April 30 is Saint Joseph Benedict Cottolengo.\n\u00a0",

Ironically, we have little reliable information about him.\nIt is known that he became a priest, engaged in missionary work, and founded many monasteries, including his principal abbey in southwestern Wales. Many stories and legends sprang up about David and his Welsh monks. Their austerity was extreme. They worked in silence without the help of animals to till the soil. Their food was limited to bread, vegetables and water.\nIn about the year 550, David attended a synod where his eloquence impressed his fellow monks to such a degree that he was elected primate of the region. The episcopal see was moved to Mynyw, where he had his monastery, now called St. David\u2019s. He ruled his diocese until he had reached a very old age. His last words to his monks and subjects were: \u201cBe joyful, brothers and sisters. Keep your faith, and do the little things that you have seen and heard with me.\u201d\nSaint\u00a0David is pictured standing on a mound with a dove on his shoulder. The legend is that once while he was preaching a dove descended to his shoulder and the earth rose to lift him high above the people so that he could be heard. Over 50 churches in South Wales were dedicated to him in pre-Reformation days.\nReflection\nWere we restricted to hard manual labor and a diet of bread, vegetables and water, most of us would find little reason to rejoice. Yet joy is what David urged on his brothers as he lay dying. Perhaps he could say that to them\u2014and to us\u2014because he lived in and nurtured a constant awareness of God\u2019s nearness.

She was betrothed to the Duke of Silesia, who died three years later. As she grew up, she decided she wanted to enter the religious life.\nAfter declining marriages to King Henry VII of Germany and King Henry III of England, Agnes was faced with a proposal from Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor. She appealed to Pope Gregory IX for help. The pope was persuasive; Frederick magnanimously said that he could not be offended if Agnes preferred the King of Heaven to him.\nAfter Agnes built a hospital for the poor and a residence for the friars, she financed the construction of a Poor Clare monastery in Prague. In 1236, she and seven other noblewomen entered this monastery. Saint\u00a0Clare sent five sisters from San Damiano to join them, and wrote Agnes four letters advising her on the beauty of her vocation and her duties as abbess.\nAgnes became known for prayer, obedience and mortification. Papal pressure forced her to accept her election as abbess, nevertheless, the title she preferred was \u201csenior sister.\u201d Her position did not prevent her from cooking for the other sisters and mending the clothes of lepers. The sisters found her kind but very strict regarding the observance of poverty; she declined her royal brother\u2019s offer to set up an endowment for the monastery.\nDevotion to Agnes arose soon after her death on March 6, 1282. She was canonized in 1989.\nReflection\nAgnes spent at least 45 years in a Poor Clare monastery. Such a life requires a great deal of patience and charity. The temptation to selfishness certainly didn\u2019t vanish when Agnes walked into the monastery. It is perhaps easy for us to think that cloistered nuns \u201chave it made\u201d regarding holiness. Their route is the same as ours: gradual exchange of our standards\u2014inclinations to selfishness\u2014for God\u2019s standard of generosity.",

        "about": "\u00a0\nKatharine Drexel\u2019s Story\nIf your father is an international banker and you ride in a private railroad car, you are not likely to be drawn into a life of voluntary poverty. But if your mother opens your home to the poor three days each week and your father spends half an hour each evening in prayer, it is not impossible that you will devote your life to the poor and give away millions of dollars. Katharine Drexel did that.\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1858, she had an excellent education and traveled widely. As a rich girl, Katharine also had a grand debut into society. But when she nursed her stepmother through a three-year terminal illness, she saw that all the Drexel money could not buy safety from pain or death, and her life took a profound turn.\nKatharine had always been interested in the plight of the Indians, having been appalled by what she read in Helen Hunt Jackson\u2019s A Century of Dishonor. While on a European tour, she met Pope Leo XIII and asked him to send more missionaries to Wyoming for her friend Bishop James O\u2019Connor. The pope replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you become a missionary?\u201d His answer shocked her into considering new possibilities.\nBack home, Katharine visited the Dakotas, met the Sioux leader Red Cloud and began her systematic aid to Indian missions.\nKatharine Drexel could easily have married. But after much discussion with Bishop O\u2019Connor, she wrote in 1889, \u201cThe feast of Saint Joseph brought me the grace to give the remainder of my life to the Indians and the Colored.\u201d Newspaper headlines screamed \u201cGives Up Seven Million!\u201d\nAfter three and a half years of training, Mother Drexel and her first band of nuns\u2014Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored\u2014opened a boarding school in Santa Fe. A string of foundations followed. By 1942, she had a system of black Catholic schools in 13 states, plus 40 mission centers and 23 rural schools. Segregationists harassed her work, even burning a school in Pennsylvania. In all, she established 50 missions for Indians in 16 states.\nTwo saints met when Mother Drexel was advised by Mother Cabrini about the \u201cpolitics\u201d of getting her order\u2019s Rule approved in Rome. Her crowning achievement was the founding of Xavier University in New Orleans, the first Catholic university in the United States for African Americans.\nAt 77, Mother Drexel suffered a heart attack and was forced to retire. Apparently her life was over. But now came almost 20 years of quiet, intense prayer from a small room overlooking the sanctuary. Small notebooks and slips of paper record her various prayers, ceaseless aspirations, and meditations. She died at 96 and was canonized in 2000.\nReflection\nSaints have always said the same thing: Pray, be humble, accept the cross, love and forgive. But it is good to hear these things in the American idiom from one who, for instance, had her ears pierced as a teenager, who resolved to have \u201cno cake, no preserves,\u201d who wore a watch, was interviewed by the press, traveled by train, and could concern herself with the proper size of pipe for a new mission. These are obvious reminders that holiness can be lived in today\u2019s culture as well as in that of Jerusalem or Rome.\n\u00a0",

Even his critics could not say that his conscientious objection indicated softness. As a teenager, Casimir lived a highly disciplined, even severe life, sleeping on the ground, spending a great part of the night in prayer and dedicating himself to lifelong celibacy.\nWhen nobles in Hungary became dissatisfied with their king, they prevailed upon Casimir\u2019s father, the king of Poland, to send his son to take over the country. Casimir obeyed his father, as many young men over the centuries have obeyed their governments. The army he was supposed to lead was clearly outnumbered by the \u201cenemy\u201d; some of his troops were deserting because they were not paid. At the advice of his officers, Casimir decided to return home.\nHis father was irked at the failure of his plans, and confined his 15-year-old son for three months. The lad made up his mind never again to become involved in the wars of his day, and no amount of persuasion could change his mind. He returned to prayer and study, maintaining his decision to remain celibate even under pressure to marry the emperor\u2019s daughter.\nHe reigned briefly as king of Poland during his father\u2019s absence. He died of lung trouble at 25 while visiting Lithuania, of which he was also Grand Duke. He was buried in Vilnius, Lithuania.\nReflection\nFor many years, Poland and Lithuania faded into the gray prison on the other side of the Iron Curtain. Despite repression, the Poles and Lithuanians remained firm in the faith which has become synonymous with their name. Their youthful patron reminds us: Peace is not won by war; sometimes a comfortable peace is not even won by virtue, but Christ\u2019s peace can penetrate every government repression of religion.\nSaint Casimir is the Patron Saint of:\nLithuania\nPoland\nRussia\nAnother Saint of the Day for March 4 is Servant of God Sylvester of Assisi.\n\u00a0",

At 16, he joined the Franciscans in Naples; he was the first Italian to follow the reform movement of Saint\u00a0Peter Alcantara. John Joseph\u2019s reputation for holiness prompted his superiors to put him in charge of establishing a new friary even before he was ordained.\nObedience moved John Joseph to accept appointments as novice master, guardian and, finally, provincial. His years of mortification enabled him to offer these services to the friars with great charity. As guardian he was not above working in the kitchen or carrying the wood and water needed by the friars.\nWhen his term as provincial expired, John Joseph dedicated himself to hearing confessions and practicing mortification, two concerns contrary to the spirit of the dawning Age of Enlightenment. John Joseph of the Cross was canonized in 1839.\nReflection\nJohn Joseph\u2019s mortification allowed him to be the kind of forgiving superior intended by Saint\u00a0Francis. Self-denial should lead us to charity\u2014not to bitterness; it should help us clarify our priorities and make us more loving. John Joseph is living proof of Chesterton\u2019s observation: \u201cIt is always easy to let the age have its head; the difficult thing is to keep one\u2019s own\u201d (G. K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy, page 101).",

Can it be called by any other name than what it is?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 he replied. \u2018So also I cannot call myself by any other name than what I am\u2014a Christian.\u2019\u201d\nSo writes Perpetua: young, beautiful, well-educated, a noblewoman of Carthage in North Africa, mother of an infant son and chronicler of the persecution of the Christians by Emperor Septimius Severus.\nPerpetua\u2019s mother was a Christian and her father a pagan. He continually pleaded with her to deny her faith. She refused and was imprisoned at 22.\nIn her diary, Perpetua describes her period of captivity: \u201cWhat a day of horror! Terrible heat, owing to the crowds! Rough treatment by the soldiers! To crown all, I was tormented with anxiety for my baby\u2026. Such anxieties I suffered for many days, but I obtained leave for my baby to remain in the prison with me, and being relieved of my trouble and anxiety for him, I at once recovered my health, and my prison became a palace to me and I would rather have been there than anywhere else.\u201d\nDespite threats of persecution and death, Perpetua, Felicity\u2013a slavewoman and expectant mother\u2013and three companions, Revocatus, Secundulus and Saturninus, refused to renounce their Christian faith. For their unwillingness, all were sent to the public games in the amphitheater.

Consider Anne Frank, the Jewish girl who with her family, was forced into hiding and later died in Bergen-Belsen, one of Hitler\u2019s death camps during World War II. Anne, like Perpetua and Felicity, endured hardship and suffering and finally death because she committed herself to God. In her diary, Anne writes, \u201cIt\u2019s twice as hard for us young ones to hold our ground, and maintain our opinions, in a time when all ideals are being shattered and destroyed, when people are showing their worst side, and do not know whether to believe in truth and right and God.\u201d\nSaint Felicity is the Patron Saint of:\nWidows\nMothers of Deceased Sons\n\u00a0",

He decided to give the rest of his life to God\u2019s service, and headed at once for Africa where he hoped to free captive Christians and, possibly, be martyred.\nHe was soon advised that his desire for martyrdom was not spiritually well based, and returned to Spain and the relatively prosaic activity of a religious goods store. Yet he was still not settled. Moved initially by a sermon of Saint John of Avila, he one day engaged in a public beating of himself, begging mercy and wildly repenting for his past life.\nCommitted to a mental hospital for these actions, John was visited by Saint John, who advised him to be more actively involved in tending to the needs of others rather than in enduring personal hardships. John gained peace of heart, and shortly after left the hospital to begin work among the poor.\nHe established a house where he wisely tended to the needs of the sick poor, at first doing his own begging. But, excited by the saint\u2019s great work and inspired by his devotion, many people began to back him up with money and provisions. Among them were the archbishop and marquis of Tarifa.\nBehind John\u2019s outward acts of total concern and love for Christ\u2019s sick poor was a deep interior prayer life which was reflected in his spirit of humility. These qualities attracted helpers who, 20 years after John\u2019s death, formed the Brothers Hospitallers, now a worldwide religious order.\nJohn became ill after 10 years of service, but tried to disguise his ill health. He began to put the hospital\u2019s administrative work into order and appointed a leader for his helpers. He died under the care of a spiritual friend and admirer, Lady Ana Ossorio.\nReflection\nThe utter humility of John of God, which led to a totally selfless dedication to others, is most impressive. Here is a man who realized his nothingness in the face of God. The Lord blessed him with the gifts of prudence, patience, courage, enthusiasm, and the ability to influence and inspire others. He saw that in his early life he had turned away from the Lord, and, moved to receive his mercy, John began his new commitment to love others in openness to God\u2019s love.\nSaint John of God is the Patron Saint of:\nBooksellers\nFirefighters\nHeart Patients\nHospitals\nNurses\nPrinters\nSick\n\u00a0",

A devoted and loving wife, she longed for a lifestyle of prayer and service, so she organized a group of women to minister to the needs of Rome\u2019s poor.\nBorn of wealthy parents, Frances found herself attracted to the religious life during her youth. But her parents objected and a young nobleman was selected to be her husband.\nAs she became acquainted with her new relatives, Frances soon discovered that the wife of her husband\u2019s brother also wished to live a life of service and prayer. So the two, Frances and Vannozza, set out together\u2014with their husbands\u2019 blessings\u2014to help the poor.\nFrances fell ill for a time, but this apparently only deepened her commitment to the suffering people she met. The years passed, and Frances gave birth to two sons and a daughter. With the new responsibilities of family life, the young mother turned her attention more to the needs of her own household.\nThe family flourished under Frances\u2019 care, but within a few years a great plague began to sweep across Italy. It struck Rome with devastating cruelty and left Frances\u2019 second son dead. In an effort to help alleviate some of the suffering, Frances used all her money and sold her possessions to buy whatever the sick might possibly need. When all the resources had been exhausted, Frances and Vannozza went door to door begging. Later, Frances\u2019 daughter died, and the saint opened a section of her house as a hospital.\nFrances became more and more convinced that this way of life was so necessary for the world, and it was not long before she requested and was given permission to found a society of women bound by no vows. They simply offered themselves to God and to the service of the poor. Once the society was established, Frances chose not to live at the community residence, but rather at home with her husband. She did this for seven years, until her husband passed away, and then came to live the remainder of her life with the society\u2014serving the poorest of the poor.\nReflection\nLooking at the exemplary life of fidelity to God and devotion to her fellow human beings which Frances of Rome was blessed to lead, one cannot help but be reminded of Saint Teresa of Calcutta, who loved Jesus Christ in prayer and also in the poor. The life of Frances of Rome calls each of us not only to look deeply for God in prayer, but also to carry our devotion to Jesus living in the suffering of our world. Frances shows us that this life need not be restricted to those bound by vows.\nSaint Frances of Rome is the Patron Saint of:\nMotorists\nWidows",

Among them was Dominic Savio, the patron of choirboys.\nBorn into a peasant family at Riva, Italy, young Dominic joined Saint John Bosco as a student at the Oratory in Turin at the age of 12. He impressed Don Bosco with his desire to be a priest and to help him in his work with neglected boys. A peacemaker and an organizer, young Dominic founded a group he called the Company of the Immaculate Conception which, besides being devotional, aided John Bosco with the boys and with manual work. All the members save one, Dominic, would, in 1859, join Don Bosco in the beginnings of his Salesian congregation. By that time, Dominic had been called home to heaven.\nAs a youth, Dominic spent hours rapt in prayer. His raptures he called \u201cmy distractions.\u201d Even in play, he said that at times, \u201cIt seems heaven is opening just above me. I am afraid I may say or do something that will make the other boys laugh.\u201d Dominic would say, \u201cI can\u2019t do big things. But I want all I do, even the smallest thing, to be for the greater glory of God.\u201d\nDominic\u2019s health, always frail, led to lung problems and he was sent home to recuperate. As was the custom of the day, he was bled in the thought that this would help, but it only worsened his condition. He died on March 9, 1857, after receiving the Last Sacraments. Saint John Bosco himself wrote the account of his life.\nSome thought that Dominic was too young to be considered a saint. Saint Pius X declared that just the opposite was true, and went ahead with his cause. Dominic was canonized in 1954. His Liturgical Feast Day is March 9.\nReflection\nLike many a youngster, Dominic was painfully aware that he was different from his peers. He tried to keep his piety from his friends lest he have to endure their laughter. Even after his death, his youth marked him as a misfit among the saints and some argued that he was too young to be canonized. Pope Pius X wisely disagreed. For no one is too young\u2014or too old or too anything else\u2014to achieve the holiness to which we all are called.\nSaint Dominic Savio is the Patron Saint of:\nChoirboys\nJuvenile delinquents\n\u00a0",

His father raised him as a Calvinist, sending him to the continent to be educated. There, John became interested in the popular debates going on between Catholic and Calvinist scholars. Confused by the arguments of Catholic scholars whom he sought out, he turned to Scripture. Two texts particularly struck him: \u201cGod wills all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth,\u201d and \u201cCome to me all you who are weary and find life burdensome, and I will refresh you.\u201d\nSlowly, John came to see that the Catholic Church could embrace all kinds of people. Among these, he noted, were many martyrs. He decided to become Catholic and was received into the Church at Louvain, Belgium, in 1596 at the age of 17.\nJohn continued his studies, first with the Benedictines, then as a student at the Jesuit College at Olmutz. He joined the Jesuits and for the next 10 years underwent their rigorous intellectual and spiritual training. At his ordination to the priesthood in France in 1610, John met two Jesuits who had just returned from Scotland after suffering arrest and imprisonment. They saw little hope for any successful work there in view of the tightening of the penal laws. But a fire had been lit within John. For the next two and a half years he pleaded to be placed there as a missionary.\nSent by his superiors, he secretly entered Scotland posing as a horse trader or a soldier returning from the wars in Europe. Unable to do significant work among the relatively few Catholics in Scotland, John made his way back to Paris to consult his superiors. Rebuked for having left his assignment in Scotland, he was sent back. He warmed to the task before him and had some success in making converts and in secretly serving Scottish Catholics. But he was soon betrayed, arrested, and brought before the court.\nHis trial dragged on until he had been without food for 26 hours. He was imprisoned and deprived of sleep. For eight days and nights he was dragged around, prodded with sharp sticks, his hair pulled out. Still, he refused to reveal the names of Catholics or to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the king in spiritual affairs. He underwent a second and third trial but held firm.\nAt his final trial, he assured his judges: \u201cIn all that concerns the king, I will be slavishly obedient; if any attack his temporal power, I will shed my last drop of blood for him. But in the things of spiritual jurisdiction which a king unjustly seizes I cannot and must not obey.\u201d\nCondemned to death as a traitor, he was faithful to the end, even when on the scaffold he was offered his freedom and a fine living if he would deny his faith. His courage in prison and in his martyrdom was reported throughout Scotland.\nJohn Ogilvie was canonized in 1976, becoming the first Scottish saint since 1250.\nReflection\nJohn came of age when neither Catholics nor Protestants were willing to tolerate one another. Turning to Scripture, he found words that enlarged his vision. Although he became a Catholic and died for his faith, he understood the meaning of \u201csmall-c catholic,\u201d the wide range of believers who embrace Christianity. Even now he undoubtedly rejoices in the ecumenical spirit fostered by the Second Vatican Council and joins us in our prayer for unity with all believers.\n",

He saw it as a way to help reinforce the faith of his people and as an antidote against the heresy of Arianism, which denied the divinity of Christ. By the end of his life, Leander had helped Christianity flourish in Spain at a time of political and religious upheaval.\nLeander\u2019s own family was heavily influenced by Arianism, but he himself grew up to be a fervent Christian. He entered a monastery as a young man and spent three years in prayer and study. At the end of that tranquil period he was made a bishop. For the rest of his life he worked strenuously to fight against heresy. The death of the anti-Christian king in 586 helped Leander\u2019s cause. He and the new king worked hand in hand to restore orthodoxy and a renewed sense of morality. Leander succeeded in persuading many Arian bishops to change their loyalties.\nLeander died around 600. In Spain, he is honored as a Doctor of the Church.\nReflection\nAs we pray the Nicene Creed every Sunday, we might reflect on the fact that that same prayer is not only being prayed by every Catholic throughout the world, but by many other Christians as well. Saint\u00a0Leander introduced its recitation as a means of uniting the faithful. Let\u2019s pray that the recitation may enhance that unity today.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nSaint Louise de Marillac\u2019s Story\nBorn near Meux, France, Louise lost her mother when she was still a child, her beloved father when she was but 15. Her desire to become a nun was discouraged by her confessor, and a marriage was arranged. One son was born of this union. But Louise\u00a0soon found herself nursing her beloved husband through a long illness that finally led to his death.\nLouise was fortunate to have a wise and sympathetic counselor, Francis de Sales, and then his friend, the bishop of Belley, France. Both of these men were available to her only periodically. But from an interior illumination she understood that she was to undertake a great work under the guidance of another person she had not yet met. This was the holy priest Monsieur Vincent, later to be known as Saint Vincent de Paul.\nAt first, he was reluctant to be her confessor, busy as he was with his \u201cConfraternities of Charity.\u201d Members were aristocratic ladies of charity who were helping him nurse the poor and look after neglected children, a real need of the day. But the ladies were busy with many of their own concerns and duties. His work needed many more helpers, especially ones who were peasants themselves and therefore, close to the poor and able to win their hearts. He also needed someone who could teach them and organize them.\nOnly over a long period of time, as Vincent de Paul became more acquainted with Louise, did he come to realize that she was the answer to his prayers. She was intelligent, self-effacing, and had physical strength and endurance that belied her continuing feeble health. The missions he sent her on eventually led to four simple young women joining her. Her rented home in Paris became the training center for those accepted for the service of the sick and poor. Growth was rapid and soon there was the need for a so-called \u201crule of life,\u201d which Louise herself, under the guidance of Vincent, drew up for the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul.\nMonsieur Vincent had always been slow and prudent in his dealings with Louise and the new group. He said that he had never had any idea of starting a new community, that it was God who did everything. \u201cYour convent,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be the house of the sick; your cell, a hired room; your chapel, the parish church; your cloister, the streets of the city or the wards of the hospital.\u201d Their dress was to be that of the peasant women. It was not until years later that Vincent de Paul would finally permit four of the women to take annual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. It was still more years before the company would be formally approved by Rome and placed under the direction of Vincent\u2019s own congregation of priests.\nMany of the young women were illiterate. Still it was with reluctance that the new community undertook the care of neglected children. Louise was busy helping wherever needed despite her poor health. She traveled throughout France, establishing her community members in hospitals, orphanages and other institutions. At her death on March 15, 1660, the congregation had more than 40 houses in France. Six months later Vincent de Paul followed her in death.\nLouise de Marillac was canonized in 1934 and declared patroness of social workers in 1960.\nReflection\nIn Louise\u2019s day, serving the needs of the poor was usually a luxury only fine ladies could afford. Her mentor, Saint Vincent de Paul, wisely realized that women of peasant stock could reach poor people more effectively, and the Daughters of Charity were born under her leadership. Today, that order\u2014along with the Sisters of Charity\u2014continues to nurse the sick and aging and provide refuge for orphans. Many of its members are social workers toiling under Louise\u2019s patronage. The rest of us must share her concern for the disadvantaged.\nSaint Louise de Marillac is the Patron Saint of:\nSocial workers\n\n",

Although he longed to be a priest, there was no money for studies, and he was apprenticed to a baker. But God guided the young man\u2019s fortunes. He found work in the bakery of a monastery where he was allowed to attend classes in its Latin school. After the abbot there died, John tried the life of a hermit, but when Emperor Joseph II abolished hermitages, John again returned to Vienna and to baking.\nOne day after serving Mass at the Cathedral of St. Stephen, he called a carriage for two ladies waiting there in the rain. In their conversation they learned that he could not pursue his priestly studies because of a lack of funds. They generously offered to support both John and his friend Thaddeus, in their seminary studies. The two went to Rome, where they were drawn to Saint Alphonsus\u2019 vision of religious life and to the Redemptorists. The two young men were ordained together in 1785.\nNewly professed at age 34, Clement Mary, as he was now called, and Thaddeus were sent back to Vienna. But the religious difficulties there caused them to leave and continue north to Warsaw, Poland. There they encountered numerous German-speaking Catholics who had been left priestless by the suppression of the Jesuits. At first they had to live in great poverty and preach outdoor sermons. Eventually they were given the church of St. Benno, and for the next nine years they preached five sermons a day, two in German and three in Polish, converting many to the faith. They were active in social work among the poor, founding an orphanage and then a school for boys.\nDrawing candidates to the congregation, they were able to send missionaries to Poland, Germany, and Switzerland. All of these foundations eventually had to be abandoned because of the political and religious tensions of the times. After 20 years of difficult work, Clement Mary himself was imprisoned and expelled from the country. Only after another arrest was he able to reach Vienna, where he was to live and work the final 12 years of his life. He quickly became \u201cthe apostle of Vienna,\u201d hearing the confessions of the rich and the poor, visiting the sick, acting as a counselor to the powerful, sharing his holiness with all in the city. His crowning work was the establishment of a Catholic college in his beloved city.\nPersecution followed Clement Mary, and there were those in authority who were able for a while to stop him from preaching. An attempt was made at the highest levels to have him banished. But his holiness and fame protected him and prompted the growth of the Redemptorists. Due to his efforts, the congregation was firmly established north of the Alps by the time of his death in 1820.\nClement Mary Hofbauer was canonized in 1909. His\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is March 15.\nReflection\nClement Mary saw his life\u2019s work meet with disaster. Religious and political tensions forced him and his brothers to abandon their ministries in Germany, Poland, and Switzerland. Clement Mary himself was exiled from Poland and had to start all over again. Someone once pointed out that the followers of the crucified Jesus should see only new possibilities opening up whenever they meet failure. Clement Mary encourages us to follow his example, trusting in the Lord to guide us.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Patrick\u2019s Story\nLegends about Patrick abound; but truth is best served by our seeing two solid qualities in him: He was humble and he was courageous. The determination to accept suffering and success with equal indifference guided the life of God\u2019s instrument for winning most of Ireland for Christ.\nDetails of his life are uncertain. Current research places his dates of birth and death a little later than earlier accounts. Patrick may have been born in Dunbarton, Scotland, Cumberland, England, or in northern Wales. He called himself both a Roman and a Briton. At 16, he and a large number of his father\u2019s slaves and vassals were captured by Irish raiders and sold as slaves in Ireland. Forced to work as a shepherd, he suffered greatly from hunger and cold.\nAfter six years Patrick escaped, probably to France, and later returned to Britain at the age of 22. His captivity had meant spiritual conversion. He may have studied at Lerins, off the French coast; he spent years at Auxerre, France, and was consecrated bishop at the age of 43. His great desire was to proclaim the good news to the Irish.\nIn a dream vision it seemed \u201call the children of Ireland from their mothers\u2019 wombs were stretching out their hands\u201d to him. He understood the vision to be a call to do mission work in pagan Ireland. Despite opposition from those who felt his education had been defective, he was sent to carry out the task. He went to the west and north\u2013where the faith had never been preached\u2013obtained the protection of local kings, and made numerous converts.\nBecause of the island\u2019s pagan background, Patrick was emphatic in encouraging widows to remain chaste and young women to consecrate their virginity to Christ. He ordained many priests, divided the country into dioceses, held Church councils, founded several monasteries and continually urged his people to greater holiness in Christ.\nHe suffered much opposition from pagan druids and was criticized in both England and Ireland for the way he conducted his mission. In a relatively short time, the island had experienced deeply the Christian spirit, and was prepared to send out missionaries whose efforts were greatly responsible for Christianizing Europe.\nPatrick was a man of action, with little inclination toward learning. He had a rock-like belief in his vocation, in the cause he had espoused. One of the few certainly authentic writings is his Confessio, above all an act of homage to God for having called Patrick, unworthy sinner, to the apostolate.\nThere is hope rather than irony in the fact that his burial place is said to be in County Down in Northern Ireland, long the scene of strife and violence.\nReflection\nWhat distinguishes Patrick is the durability of his efforts. When one considers the state of Ireland when he began his mission work, the vast extent of his labors, and how the seeds he planted continued to grow and flourish, one can only admire the kind of man Patrick must have been. The holiness of a person is known only by the fruits of his or her work.\nSaint Patrick is the Patron Saint of:\nEngineers\nIreland\nNigeria\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Cyril of Jerusalem\u2019s Story\nThe crises that the Church faces today may seem minor when compared with the threat posed by the Arian heresy, which denied the divinity of Christ and almost overcame Christianity in the fourth century. Cyril was to be caught up in the controversy, accused of Arianism by Saint Jerome, and ultimately vindicated both by the men of his own time and by being declared a Doctor of the Church in 1822.\nRaised in Jerusalem and well-educated, especially in the Scriptures, he was ordained a priest by the bishop of Jerusalem and given the task during Lent of catechizing those preparing for Baptism and catechizing the newly baptized during the Easter season. His Catecheses remain valuable as examples of the ritual and theology of the Church in the mid-fourth century.\nThere are conflicting reports about the circumstances of his becoming bishop of Jerusalem. It is certain that he was validly consecrated by bishops of the province. Since one of them was an Arian, Acacius, it may have been expected that his \u201ccooperation\u201d would follow. Conflict soon rose between Cyril and Acacius, bishop of the rival nearby see of Caesarea. Cyril was summoned to a council, accused of insubordination and of selling Church property to relieve the poor. Probably, however, a theological difference was also involved. He was condemned, driven from Jerusalem, and later vindicated, not without some association with and help from Semi-Arians. Half his episcopate was spent in exile; his first experience was repeated twice. He finally returned to find Jerusalem torn with heresy, schism and strife, and wracked with crime. Even Saint Gregory of Nyssa, who was sent to help, left in despair.\nThey both went to the Council of Constantinople, where the amended form of the Nicene Creed was promulgated in 381. Cyril accepted the word consubstantial\u2014that is, Christ is of the same substance or nature as the Father. Some said it was an act of repentance, but the bishops of the Council praised him as a champion of orthodoxy against the Arians. Though not friendly with the greatest defender of orthodoxy against the Arians, Cyril may be counted among those whom Athanasius called \u201cbrothers, who mean what we mean, and differ only about the word consubstantial.\u201d\nReflection\nThose who imagine that the lives of saints are simple and placid, untouched by the vulgar breath of controversy, are rudely shocked by history. Yet, it should be no surprise that saints, indeed all Christians, will experience the same difficulties as their Master. The definition of truth is an endless, complex pursuit, and good men and women have suffered the pain of both controversy and error. Intellectual, emotional, and political roadblocks may slow up people like Cyril for a time. But their lives taken as a whole are monuments to honesty and courage.\n",

The quality meant a lot more than faithfulness in paying debts.\nWhen the Bible speaks of God \u201cjustifying\u201d someone, it means that God, the all-holy or \u201crighteous\u201d one, so transforms a person that the individual shares somehow in God\u2019s own holiness, and hence it is really \u201cright\u201d for God to love him or her. In other words, God is not playing games, acting as if we were lovable when we are not.\nBy saying Joseph was \u201cjust,\u201d the Bible means that he was one who was completely open to all that God wanted to do for him. He became holy by opening himself totally to God.\nThe rest we can easily surmise. Think of the kind of love with which he wooed and won Mary, and the depth of the love they shared during their marriage.\nIt is no contradiction of Joseph\u2019s manly holiness that he decided to divorce Mary when she was found to be with child. The important words of the Bible are that he planned to do this \u201cquietly\u201d because he was \u201ca righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame\u201d (Matthew 1:19).\nThe just man was simply, joyfully, wholeheartedly obedient to God\u2014in marrying Mary, in naming Jesus, in shepherding the precious pair to Egypt, in bringing them to Nazareth, in the undetermined number of years of quiet faith and courage.\nReflection\nThe Bible tells us nothing of Joseph in the years after the return to Nazareth except the incident of finding Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:41\u201351). Perhaps this can be taken to mean that God wants us to realize that the holiest family was like every other family, that the circumstances of life for the holiest family were like those of every family, so that when Jesus\u2019 mysterious nature began to appear, people couldn\u2019t believe that he came from such humble beginnings: \u201cIs he not the carpenter\u2019s son? Is not his mother named Mary\u2026?\u201d (Matthew 13:55a).

Public recognition can be a nuisance at times\u2014as the confreres of Salvator found out.\nSalvator was born during Spain\u2019s Golden Age. Art, politics, and wealth were flourishing. So was religion. Ignatius of Loyola founded the Society of Jesus in 1540.\nSalvator\u2019s parents were poor. At the age of 21, he entered the Franciscans as a brother and was soon known for his asceticism, humility, and simplicity. As cook, porter, and later the official beggar for the friars in Tortosa, he became well known for his charity. He healed the sick with the Sign of the Cross. When crowds of sick people began coming to the friary to see Salvator, the friars transferred him to Horta. Again, the sick flocked to ask his intercession; one person estimated that 2,000\u00a0people a week came to see Salvator. He told them to examine their consciences, go to confession, and to receive Holy Communion worthily. He refused to pray for those who would not receive those sacraments.\nThe public attention given to Salvator was relentless. The crowds would sometimes tear off pieces of his habit as relics. Two years before his death, Salvator was moved again, this time to Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. He died at Cagliari saying, \u201cInto your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit.\u201d He was canonized in 1938.\nReflection\nMedical science is now seeing more clearly the relation of some diseases to one\u2019s emotional and spiritual life. In Healing Life\u2019s Hurts, Matthew and Dennis Linn report that sometimes people experience relief from illness only when they have decided to forgive others. Salvator prayed that people might be healed, and many were. Surely not all diseases can be treated this way; medical help should not be abandoned. But notice that Salvator urged his petitioners to reestablish their priorities in life before\u00a0they asked for healing.\n",

It was when he was a young philosophy professor known for his piety and learning that God called him to bid good-bye to the world he was used to and enter the new world of the Franciscan Order. After his profession, John was sent to Paris to complete his theological studies. Ordained to the priesthood, he was appointed to teach theology at Bologna, then Naples, and finally Rome.\nIn 1245, Pope Innocent IV called a general council in the city of Lyons, France. Crescentius, the Franciscan minister general at the time, was ailing and unable to attend. In his place he sent Friar John, who made a deep impression on the Church leaders gathered there. Two years later, when the same pope presided at the election of a minister general of the Franciscans, he remembered Friar John well and held him up as the man best qualified for the office.\nAnd so in 1247, John of Parma was elected to be minister general. The surviving disciples of St. Francis rejoiced in his election, expecting a return to the spirit of poverty and humility of the early days of the Order. And they were not disappointed. As general of the Order, John traveled on foot, accompanied by one or two companions, to practically all of the Franciscan convents in existence. Sometimes he would arrive and not be recognized, remaining there for a number of days to test the true spirit of the brothers.\nThe pope called on John to serve as legate to Constantinople, where he was most successful in winning back the schismatic Greeks. Upon his return, he asked that someone else take his place to govern the Order. At John\u2019s urging, Saint Bonaventure was chosen to succeed him. John took up a life of prayer in the hermitage at Greccio.\nMany years later, John learned that the Greeks who had been reconciled with the Church for a time, had relapsed into schism. Though 80 years old by then, John received permission from Pope Nicholas IV to return to the East in an effort to restore unity once again. On his way, John fell sick and died.\nHe was beatified in 1781.\nReflection\nIn the 13th century, people in their 30s were middle-aged; hardly anyone lived to the ripe old age of 80. John did, but he didn\u2019t ease into retirement. Instead he was on his way to try to heal a schism in the Church when he died. Our society today boasts a lot of folks in their later decades. Like John, many of them lead active lives. But some aren\u2019t so fortunate. Weakness or ill health keeps them confined and lonely\u2014waiting to hear from us.\n\u00a0",

Over a period of about 20 years, Nicholas used his skills to build secret hiding places for priests throughout the country.\nHis work, which he did completely by himself as both architect and builder, was so good that time and time again priests in hiding were undetected by raiding parties. Nicholas was a genius at finding and creating places of safety: subterranean passages, small spaces between walls, impenetrable recesses.\nAt one point he was even able to mastermind the escape of two Jesuits from the Tower of London.

        "about": "(November 16, 1538 \u2013 March 23, 1606)\n\u00a0\nSaint Turibius of Mogrovejo\u2019s Story\nTogether with Rose of Lima, Turibius is the first known saint of the New World, serving the Lord in Peru, South America, for 26 years.\nBorn in Spain and educated for the law, he became so brilliant a scholar that he was made professor of law at the University of Salamanca and eventually became chief judge of the Inquisition at Granada. He succeeded too well. But he was not sharp enough a lawyer to prevent a surprising sequence of events.\nWhen the archdiocese of Lima in Peru required a new leader, Turibius was chosen to fill the post: He was the one person with the strength of character and holiness of spirit to heal the scandals that had infected that area.\nHe cited all the canons that forbade giving laymen ecclesiastical dignities, but he was overruled. Turibius was ordained priest and bishop and sent to Peru, where he found colonialism at its worst. The Spanish conquerors were guilty of every sort of oppression of the native population. Abuses among the clergy were flagrant, and he devoted his energies and suffering to this area first.\nHe began the long and arduous visitation of an immense archdiocese, studying the language, staying two or three days in each place, often with neither bed nor food. Turibius confessed every morning to his chaplain, and celebrated Mass with intense fervor. Among those to whom he gave the Sacrament of Confirmation was the future Saint Rose of Lima, and possibly the future Saint Martin de Porres. After 1590, he had the help of another great missionary, Francis Solanus, now also a saint.\nThough very poor his people were sensitive, dreading to accept public charity from others. Turibius solved the problem by helping them anonymously.\nReflection\nThe Lord indeed writes straight with crooked lines. Against his will, and from the unlikely springboard of an Inquisition tribunal, this man became the Christlike shepherd of a poor and oppressed people. God gave him the gift of loving others as they needed it.\n",

        "about": "\nSaint Oscar Romero\u2019s Story\nThe night before he was murdered while celebrating Mass, Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador said on the radio: \u201cI would like to appeal in a special way to the men of the army, and in particular to the troops of the National Guard, the police, and the garrisons. Brothers, you belong to our own people. You kill your own brother peasants; and in the face of an order to kill that is given by a man, the law of God that says \u2018Do not kill!\u2019 should prevail.\n\u201cNo soldier is obliged to obey an order counter to the law of God. No one has to comply with an immoral law. It is the time now that you recover your conscience and obey its dictates rather than the command of sin. . . . Therefore, in the name of God, and in the name of this long-suffering people, whose laments rise to heaven every day more tumultuous, I beseech you, I beg you, I command you! In the name of God: \u2018Cease the repression!\u2019\u201d\nSimultaneously, Romero had eloquently upheld the gospel and effectively signed his own death warrant.\n\nWhen he was appointed archbishop of San Salvador in 1977, Bishop Romero was considered a very \u201csafe\u201d choice. He had served as auxiliary bishop there for four years before his three years as bishop of Santiago de Maria.\nOscar\u2019s father wanted him to be a carpenter\u2014a trade for which he demonstrated some talent. Seminary classes in El Salvador preceded his studies at Rome\u2019s Gregorian University and his ordination in 1942. After earning a doctorate in ascetical theology, he returned home and became a parish priest and later rector of an interdiocesan seminary.\nThree weeks after his appointment as archbishop, Romero was shaken by the murder of his good friend Jesuit Father Rutilio Grande, a vigorous defender of the rights of the poor. Five more priests were assassinated in the Archdiocese of San Salvador during Romero\u2019s years as its shepherd.\nWhen a military junta seized control of the national government in 1979, Archbishop Romero publicly criticized the US government for backing the junta. His weekly radio sermons, broadcast throughout the country, were regarded by many as the most trustworthy source of news available.\nRomero\u2019s funeral was celebrated in the plaza outside the cathedral and drew an estimated 250,000 mourners.\nHis tomb in the cathedral crypt soon drew thousands of visitors each year. On February 3, 2015, Pope Francis authorized a decree recognizing Oscar Romero as a martyr for the faith. His beatification took place in San Salvador on May 23, 2015. He was canonized on October 14, 2018.\nReflection\nOscar Romero and many other Latin American martyrs for the faith were falsely accused of advocating a Marxist-inspired \u201ctheology of liberation.\u201d Following Jesus always requires choices. Romero\u2019s fiercest critics conveniently dismissed his choices as politically inspired. An incarnational faith must be expressed publicly.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Annunciation of the Lord\nThe feast of the Annunciation, now recognized as a solemnity, was first celebrated in the fourth or fifth century. Its central focus is the Incarnation: God has become one of us. From all eternity God had decided that the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity should become human. Now, as Luke 1:26-38 tells us, the decision is being realized. The God-Man embraces all humanity, indeed all creation, to bring it to God in one great act of love. Because human beings have rejected God, Jesus will accept a life of suffering and an agonizing death: \u201cNo one has greater love than this, to lay down one\u2019s life for one\u2019s friends\u201d (John 15:13).\nMary has an important role to play in God\u2019s plan. From all eternity, God destined her to be the mother of Jesus and closely related to him in the creation and redemption of the world. We could say that God\u2019s decrees of creation and redemption are joined in the decree of Incarnation. Because Mary is God\u2019s instrument in the Incarnation, she has a role to play with Jesus in creation and redemption. It is a God-given role. It is God\u2019s grace from beginning to end. Mary becomes the eminent figure she is only by God\u2019s grace. She is the empty space where God could act. Everything she is she owes to the Trinity.\nMary\u00a0is the virgin-mother who fulfills Isaiah 7:14 in a way that Isaiah could not have imagined. She is united with her son in carrying out the will of God (Psalm 40:8-9; Hebrews 10:7-9; Luke 1:38).\nTogether with Jesus, the privileged and graced Mary is the link between heaven and earth. She is the human being who best, after Jesus, exemplifies the possibilities of human existence. She received into her lowliness the infinite love of God. She shows how an ordinary human being can reflect God in the ordinary circumstances of life. She exemplifies what the Church and every member of the Church is meant to become. She is the ultimate product of the creative and redemptive power of God. She manifests what the Incarnation is meant to accomplish for all of us.\nReflection\nSometimes spiritual writers are accused of putting Mary on a pedestal and thereby, discouraging ordinary humans from imitating her. Perhaps such an observation is misguided. God did put Mary on a pedestal and has put all human beings on a pedestal. We have scarcely begun to realize the magnificence of divine grace, the wonder of God\u2019s freely given love. The marvel of Mary\u2014even in the midst of her very ordinary life\u2014is God\u2019s shout to us to wake up to the marvelous creatures that we all are by divine design.\nClick here for more on the Annunciation!\n",

The needs of the poor and the sick were often overshadowed by a hunger for luxury and self-indulgence. Catherine\u2019s parents were members of the nobility in Genoa. At 13, she attempted to become a nun but failed because of her age. At 16, she married Julian, a nobleman who turned out to be selfish and unfaithful. For a while she tried to numb her disappointment by a life of selfish pleasure.\nOne day in confession she had a new sense of her own sins and how much God loved her. She reformed her life and gave good example to Julian, who soon turned from his self-centered life of distraction. Julian\u2019s spending, however, had ruined them financially. He and Catherine decided to live in the Pammatone, a large hospital in Genoa, and to dedicate themselves to works of charity there. After Julian\u2019s death in 1497, Catherine took over management of the hospital.\nShe wrote about purgatory which, she said, begins on earth for souls open to God. Life with God in heaven is a continuation and perfection of the life with God begun on earth.\nExhausted by her life of self-sacrifice, Catherine died September 15, 1510, and was canonized in 1737.\nReflection\nRegular confession and frequent Communion can help us see the direction\u2013or drift\u2013of our life with God. People who have a realistic sense of their own sinfulness and of the greatness of God are often the ones who are most ready to meet the needs of their neighbors. Saint Catherine began her hospital work with enthusiasm and was faithful to it through difficult times because she was inspired by the love of God, a love which was renewed in her by the Scriptures and the sacraments.\nClick here for more on Sacrament of Reconciliation!\n",

He is supposed to have left a written account of what he saw in the next world before he was called back to life. Some say he followed Peter into Syria. Another story is that despite being put into a leaking boat by the Jews at Jaffa, he, his sisters, and others landed safely in Cyprus. There he died peacefully after serving as bishop for 30 years.\nA church was built in his honor in Constantinople and some of his reputed relics were transferred there in 890. A Western legend has the oarless boat arriving in Gaul. There he was bishop of Marseilles, was martyred after making a number of converts, and was buried in a cave. His relics were transferred to the new cathedral in Autun in 1146.\nIt is certain there was early devotion to the saint. Around the year 390, the pilgrim lady Etheria talks of the procession that took place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday at the tomb where Lazarus had been raised from the dead. In the West, Passion Sunday was called Dominica de Lazaro, and Augustine tells us that in Africa the Gospel of the raising of Lazarus was read at the office of Palm Sunday.\nReflection\nMany people who have had a near-death experience report losing all fear of death. When Lazarus died a second time, perhaps he was without fear. He must have been sure that Jesus, the friend with whom he had shared many meals and conversations, would be waiting to raise him again. We don\u2019t share Lazarus\u2019 firsthand knowledge of returning from the grave. Nevertheless, we too have shared meals and conversations with Jesus, who waits to raise us, too.\nAnother Saint of the Day for March 27 is Blessed Francis Fa\u00e0 di Bruno.\n",

She received a liberal education at the court and developed some interest and talent in painting. In later years as a Poor Clare, Catharine sometimes did manuscript illumination and also painted miniatures.\nAt the age of 17, she joined a group of religious women in Ferrara.

After his ordination five years later, he taught chemistry, physics, and mathematics to younger members of his province for several years.\nIn 1847, he had a mystical experience which he later described as a cleansing. After that, he dedicated his life to the poor and the infirm, establishing a dispensary for the poor, two schools for African children, an institute for the children of nobility, as well as an institution for orphans, the deaf, and the speechless, and other institutes for the blind, elderly, and for travelers. In addition to an infirmary for friars of his province, he began charitable institutes in Naples, Florence, and Assisi. He once said, \u201cChrist\u2019s love has wounded my heart.\u201d This love prompted him to great acts of charity.\nTo help continue these works of mercy, in 1859 he established the Gray Brothers, a religious community composed of men who formerly belonged to the Secular Franciscan Order. Three years later, he founded the Gray Sisters of St. Elizabeth for the same purpose.\nToward the beginning of his final, nine-year illness, Ludovico wrote a spiritual testament which described faith as \u201clight in the darkness, help in sickness, blessing in tribulations, paradise in the crucifixion, and life amid death.\u201d The local work for his beatification began within five months of Ludovico\u2019s death. He was beatified in 1993 and canonized in 2014.\nReflection\nSaintly people are not protected from suffering, but with God\u2019s help they learn how to develop compassion from it.

France and England were fighting the Hundred Years\u2019 War, and in 1453, the Byzantine Empire was completely wiped out by the loss of Constantinople to the Turks. At Peter\u2019s death, the age of printing had just begun in Germany, and Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World was less than 40 years away.\nPeter came from a wealthy and pious family in Valladolid, Spain. At the age of 13, he was allowed to enter the Conventual Franciscans. Shortly after his ordination, he was made superior of the friary in Aguilar. He became part of a group of friars who wanted to lead a life of greater poverty and penance. In 1442, he was appointed head of all the Spanish Franciscans in his reform group.\nPeter led the friars by his example. A special love of the poor and the sick characterized Peter. Miraculous stories are told about his charity to the poor. For example, the bread never seemed to run out as long as Peter had hungry people to feed. Throughout most of his life, Peter went hungry; he lived only on bread and water.\nImmediately after his death on March 31, 1456, his grave became a place of pilgrimage. Peter was canonized in 1746.\nReflection\nPeter was an effective leader of the friars because he did not become ensnared in anger over the sins of others.

That year a gray-robed Franciscan founded Mission San Juan Capistrano, now famous for its annually returning swallows. San Juan was the seventh of nine missions established under the direction of this indomitable Spaniard.\nBorn on Spain\u2019s island of Mallorca, Serra entered the Franciscan Order taking the name of Saint\u00a0Francis\u2019 childlike companion, Brother Juniper. Until he was 35, he spent most of his time in the classroom\u2014first as a student of theology and then as a professor. He also became famous for his preaching. Suddenly he gave it all up and followed the yearning that had begun years before when he heard about the missionary work of Saint\u00a0Francis Solano in South America. Junipero\u2019s desire was to convert native peoples in the New World.\nArriving by ship at Vera Cruz, Mexico, he and a companion walked the 250 miles to Mexico City. On the way Junipero\u2019s left leg became infected by an insect bite and would remain a cross\u2014sometimes life-threatening\u2014for the rest of his life. For 18 years, he worked in central Mexico and in the Baja Peninsula. He became president of the missions there.\nEnter politics: the threat of a Russian invasion south from Alaska. Charles III of Spain ordered an expedition to beat Russia to the territory. So the last two conquistadors\u2014one military, one spiritual\u2014began their quest. Jos\u00e9 de Galvez persuaded Junipero to set out with him for present-day Monterey, California. The first mission founded after the 900-mile journey north was San Diego in 1769. That year a shortage of food almost canceled the expedition. Vowing to stay with the local people, Junipero and another friar began a novena in preparation for St. Joseph\u2019s day, March 19, the scheduled day of departure. On that day, the relief ship arrived.\nOther missions followed: Monterey/Carmel (1770); San Antonio and San Gabriel (1771); San Lu\u00eds Obispo (1772); San Francisco and San Juan Capistrano (1776); Santa Clara (1777); San Buenaventura (1782). Twelve more were founded after Serra\u2019s death.\nJunipero made the long trip to Mexico City to settle great differences with the military commander. He arrived at the point of death. The outcome was substantially what Junipero sought: the famous \u201cRegulation\u201d protecting the Indians and the missions. It was the basis for the first significant legislation in California, a \u201cBill of Rights\u201d for Native Americans.\nBecause the Native Americans were living a nonhuman life from the Spanish point of view, the friars were made their legal guardians. The Native Americans were kept at the mission after baptism lest they be corrupted in their former haunts\u2014a move that has brought cries of \u201cinjustice\u201d from some moderns.\nJunipero\u2019s missionary life was a long battle with cold and hunger, with unsympathetic military commanders and even with danger of death from non-Christian native peoples. Through it all his unquenchable zeal was fed by prayer each night, often from midnight till dawn. He baptized over 6,000 people and confirmed 5,000. His travels would have circled the globe. He brought the Native Americans not only the gift of faith but also a decent standard of living. He won their love, as witnessed especially by their grief at his death. He is buried at Mission San Carlo Borromeo, Carmel, and was beatified in 1988. Pope Francis canonized him in Washington, D.C., on September 23, 2015.\nReflection\nThe word that best describes Junipero is zeal. It was a spirit that came from his deep prayer and dauntless will. \u201cAlways forward, never back\u201d was his motto. His work bore fruit for 50 years after his death as the rest of the missions were founded in a kind of Christian communal living by the Indians. When both Mexican and American greed caused the secularization of the missions, the Chumash people went back to what they had been\u2014God again writing straight with crooked lines.\n",

After some years of teaching and service to the poor of Rome he was appointed Archbishop of Armagh in Ireland. Four years later, in 1673, a new wave of anti-Catholic persecution began, forcing Archbishop Plunkett to do his pastoral work in secrecy and disguise and to live in hiding. Meanwhile, many of his priests were sent into exile, schools were closed, Church services had to be held in secret, and convents and seminaries were suppressed. As archbishop, Plunkett was viewed as ultimately responsible for any rebellion or political activity among his parishioners.\nArchbishop Plunkett was arrested and imprisoned in Dublin Castle in 1679, but his trial was moved to London. After deliberating for 15 minutes, a jury found him guilty of fomenting revolt. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered in July 1681.\nPope Paul VI canonized Oliver Plunkett in 1975.\nReflection\nStories like that of Oliver Plunkett seem to fit history. \u201cThings like that don\u2019t happen today\u201d is often our thought.

He made what is certainly the most explicit statement of faith in the New Testament: \u201cMy Lord and My God!\u201d and, in so expressing his faith, gave Christians a prayer that will be said till the end of time. He also occasioned a compliment from Jesus to all later Christians: \u201cHave you come to believe because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed\u201d (John 20:29).\nThomas should be equally well-known for his courage. Perhaps what he said was impetuous\u2014since he ran, like the rest, at the showdown\u2014but he can scarcely have been insincere when he expressed his willingness to die with Jesus. The occasion was when Jesus proposed to go to Bethany after Lazarus had died. Since Bethany was near Jerusalem, this meant walking into the very midst of his enemies and to almost certain death. Realizing this, Thomas said to the other apostles, \u201cLet us also go to die with him\u201d (John 11:16b).\nReflection\nThomas shares the lot of Peter the impetuous, James and John, the \u201csons of thunder,\u201d Philip and his foolish request to see the Father\u2014indeed all the apostles in their weakness and lack of understanding. We must not exaggerate these facts, however, for Christ did not pick worthless men. But their human weakness again points up the fact that holiness is a gift of God, not a human creation; it is given to ordinary men and women with weaknesses; it is God who gradually transforms the weaknesses into the image of Christ, the courageous, trusting, and loving one.\nSaint Thomas the Apostle is the Patron Saint of:\nArchitects/Builders/Construction Workers/Surveyors\nIndia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\nTheologians\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Elizabeth of Portugal\u2019s Story\nElizabeth is usually depicted in royal garb with a dove or an olive branch. At her birth in 1271, her father Pedro III, future king of Aragon, was reconciled with his father James, the reigning monarch. This proved to be a portent of things to come. Under the healthful influences surrounding her early years, she quickly learned self-discipline and acquired a taste for spirituality.\nThus fortunately prepared, Elizabeth was able to meet the challenge when at the age of 12, she was given in marriage to Denis, king of Portugal. She was able to establish for herself a pattern of life conducive to growth in God\u2019s love, not merely through her exercises of piety, including daily Mass, but also through her exercise of charity, by which she was able to befriend and help pilgrims, strangers, the sick, the poor\u2014in a word, all those whose need came to her notice. At the same time she remained devoted to her husband, whose infidelity to her was a scandal to the kingdom.\nDenis, too, was the object of many of her peace endeavors. Elizabeth long sought peace for him with God, and was finally rewarded when he gave up his life of sin. She repeatedly sought and effected peace between the king and their rebellious son Alfonso, who thought that he was passed over to favor the king\u2019s illegitimate children. She acted as peacemaker in the struggle between Ferdinand, king of Aragon, and his cousin James, who claimed the crown. And finally from Coimbra, where she had retired as a Franciscan tertiary to the monastery of the Poor Clares after the death of her husband, Elizabeth set out and was able to bring about a lasting peace between her son Alfonso, now king of Portugal, and his son-in-law, the king of Castile.\nReflection\nThe work of promoting peace is anything but a calm and quiet endeavor. It takes a clear mind, a steady spirit and a brave soul to intervene between people whose emotions are so aroused that they are ready to destroy one another. This is all the more true of a woman in the early 14th century. But Elizabeth had a deep and sincere love and sympathy for humankind, an almost total lack of concern for herself, and an abiding confidence in God. These were the tools of her success.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Anthony Zaccaria\u2019s Story\nAt the same time that Martin Luther was attacking abuses in the Church, a reformation within the Church was already being attempted. Among the early movers of the Counter-Reformation was Anthony Zaccaria. His mother became a widow at 18, and devoted herself to the spiritual education of her son. He received a medical doctorate at 22, and while working among the poor of his native Cremona in Italy, was attracted to the religious apostolate. He renounced his rights to any future inheritance, worked as a catechist, and was ordained a priest at the age of 26. Called to Milan in a few years, he laid the foundations of three religious congregations, one for men, one for women, and an association of married couples. Their aim was the reform of the decadent society of their day, beginning with the clergy, religious, and lay people.\nGreatly inspired by Saint\u00a0Paul\u2014his congregation is named the Barnabites, after the companion of that saint\u2014Anthony preached with great vigor in church and street, conducted popular missions, and was not ashamed of doing public penance.\nHe encouraged such innovations as the collaboration of the laity in the apostolate, frequent Communion, the Forty Hours devotion, and the ringing of church bells at 3:00 p.m. on Fridays.\u00a0His holiness moved many to reform their lives, but as with all saints, it also moved many to oppose him. Twice his community had to undergo official religious investigation, and twice it was exonerated.\nWhile on a mission of peace, he became seriously ill and was brought home for a visit to his mother. He died at Cremona at the age of 36.\nReflection\nThe austerity of Anthony\u2019s spirituality and the Pauline ardor of his preaching would probably \u201cturn off\u201d many people today. When even some psychiatrists complain at the lack of a sense of sin, it may be time to tell ourselves that not all evil is explained by emotional disorder, subconscious and unconscious drives, parental influence, and so on. The old-time \u201chell and damnation\u201d mission sermons have given way to positive, encouraging, biblical homilies. We do indeed need assurance of forgiveness, relief from existential anxiety, and future shock. But we still need prophets to stand up and tell us, \u201cIf we say \u2018We are without sin,\u2019 we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us\u201d (1 John 1:8).\n",

She was the daughter of a poor Italian tenant farmer, had no chance to go to school, never learned to read or write. When Maria made her First Communion not long before her death at age 12, she was one of the larger and somewhat backward members of the class.\nOn a hot afternoon in July, Maria was sitting at the top of the stairs of her house, mending a shirt. She was not quite 12 years old, but physically mature. A cart stopped outside, and a neighbor, 18-year-old Alessandro, ran up the stairs. He seized her and pulled her into a bedroom. She struggled and tried to call for help. \u201cNo, God does not wish it,\u201d she cried out. \u201cIt is a sin. You would go to hell for it.\u201d Alessandro began striking at her blindly with a long dagger.\nMaria was taken to a hospital. Her last hours were marked by the usual simple compassion of the good\u2014concern about where her mother would sleep, forgiveness of her murderer (she had been in fear of him, but did not say anything lest she cause trouble to his family), and her devout welcoming of Viaticum, her last Holy Communion. She died about 24 hours after the attack.\nAlessandro was sentenced to 30 years in prison. For a long time he was unrepentant and surly. One night he had a dream or vision of Maria gathering flowers and offering them to him. His life changed. When he was released after 27 years, his first act was to beg the forgiveness of Maria\u2019s mother.\nDevotion to the young martyr grew, miracles were worked, and in less than half a century she was canonized. At her beatification in 1947, her 82-year-old mother, two sisters, and her brother appeared with Pope Pius XII on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s. Three years later, at Maria\u2019s canonization, a 66-year-old Alessandro Serenelli knelt among the quarter-million people and cried tears of joy.\nReflection\nMaria may have had trouble with catechism, but she had no trouble with faith. God\u2019s will was holiness, decency, respect for one\u2019s body, absolute obedience, total trust. In a complex world, her faith was simple: It is a privilege to be loved by God, and to love him\u2014at any cost.\nSaint Maria Goretti is the Patron Saint of:\n\nCatholic Youth\nGirls\nTeenagers\n\u00a0",

When the governments of Britain, Germany, Russia, and France forced substantial territorial concessions from the Chinese in 1898, anti-foreign sentiment grew very strong among many Chinese people.\nGregory Grassi was born in Italy in 1833, ordained in 1856, and sent to China five years later. Gregory was later ordained Bishop of North Shanxi. With 14 other European missionaries and 14 Chinese religious, he was martyred during the short but bloody Boxer Uprising of 1900.\nTwenty-six of these martyrs were arrested on the orders of Yu Hsien, the governor of Shanxi province. They were hacked to death on July 9, 1900. Five of them were Friars Minor; seven were Franciscan Missionaries of Mary\u2014the first martyrs of their congregation. Seven were Chinese seminarians and Secular Franciscans; four martyrs were Chinese laymen and Secular Franciscans. The other three Chinese laymen killed in Shanxi simply worked for the Franciscans and were rounded up with all the others. Three Italian Franciscans were martyred that same week in the province of Hunan. All these martyrs were beatified in 1946, and were among the 120 martyrs canonized in 2000.\nReflection\nMartyrdom is the occupational hazard of missionaries. Throughout China during the Boxer Uprising, five bishops, 50 priests, two brothers, 15 sisters and 40,000 Chinese Christians were killed. The 146,575 Catholics served by the Franciscans in China in 1906 had grown to 303,760 by 1924, and were served by 282 Franciscans and 174 local priests.

Depending on China\u2019s relations with the outside world, Christianity over the centuries was free to grow or was forced to operate secretly.\nThe 120 martyrs in this group died between 1648 and 1930. Eighty-seven of them were born in China, and were children, parents, catechists, or laborers, ranging in age from nine years to 72. This group includes four Chinese diocesan priests. The 33 foreign-born martyrs were mostly priests or women religious, especially from the Order of Preachers, the Paris Foreign Mission Society, the Friars Minor, Society of Jesus, Society of St. Francis de Sales (Salesians), and Franciscan Missionaries of Mary.\nAugustine Zhao Rong was a Chinese soldier who accompanied Bishop John Gabriel Taurin Dufresse of the Paris Foreign Mission Society to his martyrdom in Beijing. Not long after his baptism, Augustine was ordained as a diocesan priest. He was martyred in 1815.\nBeatified in groups at various times, these 120 martyrs were canonized together in Rome on October 1, 2000.\nReflection\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China and the Roman Catholic Church each have well over a billion members, but there are only about 12 million Catholics in China. The reasons for that are better explained by historical conflicts than by a wholesale rejection of the Good News of Jesus Christ. The Chinese-born martyrs honored by today\u2019s feast were regarded by their persecutors as dangerous because they were considered allies of enemy, Catholic countries. The martyrs born outside China often tried to distance themselves from European political struggles relating to China, but their persecutors saw them as Westerners and therefore, by definition, anti-Chinese.\nThe Good News of Jesus Christ is intended to benefit all peoples; today\u2019s martyrs knew that. May 21st-century Christians live in such a way that Chinese women and men will be attracted to hear that Good News and embrace it.\n",

It is said that when her mother Benedetta was dying she called her five daughters to her bedside and entrusted each of them to one of the five wounds of Jesus. Veronica was entrusted to the wound below Christ\u2019s heart.\nAt the age of 17, Veronica joined the Poor Clares directed by the Capuchins. Her father had wanted her to marry, but she convinced him to allow her to become a nun. In her first years in the monastery, she worked in the kitchen, infirmary, sacristy, and also served as portress. At the age of 34, she was made novice mistress, a position she held for 22 years. When she was 37, Veronica received the stigmata. Life was not the same after that.\nChurch authorities in Rome wanted to test Veronica\u2019s authenticity and so conducted an investigation. She lost the office of novice mistress temporarily and was not allowed to attend Mass except on Sundays or holy days. Through all of this Veronica did not become bitter, and the investigation eventually restored her as novice mistress.\nThough she protested against it, at the age of 56 she was elected abbess, an office she held for 11 years until her death. Veronica was very devoted to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart. She offered her sufferings for the missions, died in 1727, and was canonized in 1839. Her\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is July 9.\nReflection\nWhy did God grant the stigmata to Francis of Assisi and to Veronica Giuliani? God alone knows the deepest reasons, but as Celano points out, the external sign of the cross is a confirmation of these saints\u2019 commitment to the cross in their lives. The stigmata that appeared in Veronica\u2019s flesh had taken root in her heart many years before. It was a fitting conclusion for her love of God and her charity toward her sisters.",

Benedict is well recognized in the later Dialogues of Saint\u00a0Gregory, but these are sketches to illustrate miraculous elements of his career.\nBenedict was born into a distinguished family in central Italy, studied at Rome, and early in life was drawn to monasticism. At first he became a hermit, leaving a depressing world\u2014pagan armies on the march, the Church torn by schism, people suffering from war, morality at a low ebb.\nHe soon realized that he could not live a hidden life in a small town any better than in a large city, so he withdrew to a cave high in the mountains for three years. Some monks chose Benedict as their leader for a while, but found his strictness not to their taste. Still the shift from hermit to community life had begun for him. He had an idea of gathering various families of monks into one \u201cGrand Monastery\u201d to give them the benefit of unity, fraternity, and permanent worship in one house. Finally he began to build what was to become one of the most famous monasteries in the world\u2014Monte Cassino, commanding three narrow valleys running toward the mountains north of Naples.\nThe Rule that gradually developed prescribed a life of liturgical prayer, study, manual labor, and living together in community under a common abbot. Benedictine asceticism is known for its moderation, and Benedictine charity has always shown concern for the people in the surrounding countryside. In the course of the Middle Ages, all monasticism in the West was gradually brought under the Rule of St. Benedict.\nToday the Benedictine family is represented by two branches: the Benedictine Federation encompassing the men and women of the Order of St. Benedict, and the Cistercians, men and women of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance.\nReflection\nThe Church has been blessed through Benedictine devotion to the liturgy, not only in its actual celebration with rich and proper ceremony in the great abbeys, but also through the scholarly studies of many of its members. Liturgy is sometimes confused with guitars or choirs, Latin or Bach. We should be grateful to those who both preserve and adapt the genuine tradition of worship in the Church.\nSaint Benedict is the Patron Saint of:\nEurope\nKidney Disease\nMonks\nPoisoning\nSchoolchildren\n",

In 1656 he returned to work secretly in England.\nIn 1678, Titus Oates worked many English people into a frenzy over an alleged papal plot to murder the king and restore Catholicism in that country. In that year Catholics were legally excluded from Parliament, a law which was not repealed until 1829. John Wall was arrested and imprisoned in 1678, and was executed the following year.\nJohn Jones and John Wall were canonized in 1970.\nReflection\nEvery martyr knows how to save his/her life and yet refuses to do so.

Nine years after the Jesuits Isaac Jogues and Jean de Lelande were tomahawked by Iroquois warriors, a baby girl was born near the place of their martyrdom, Auriesville, New York.\nHer mother was a Christian Algonquin, taken captive by the Iroquois and given as wife to the chief of the Mohawk clan, the boldest and fiercest of the Five Nations. When she was four, Tekakwitha lost her parents and little brother in a smallpox epidemic that left her disfigured and half blind. She was adopted by an uncle, who succeeded her father as chief. He hated the coming of the Blackrobes\u2014Jesuit missionaries\u2014but could do nothing to them because a peace treaty with the French required their presence in villages with Christian captives. She was moved by the words of three Blackrobes who lodged with her uncle, but fear of him kept her from seeking instruction. Tekakwitha refused to marry a Mohawk brave, and at 19 finally got the courage to take the step of converting. She was baptized with the name Kateri\u2013Catherine\u2013on Easter Sunday.\nNow she would be treated as a slave. Because she would not work on Sunday, Kateri received no food that day. Her life in grace grew rapidly. She told a missionary that she often meditated on the great dignity of being baptized. She was powerfully moved by God\u2019s love for human beings and saw the dignity of each of her people.\nShe was always in danger, for her conversion and holy life created great opposition. On the advice of a priest, Kateri stole away one night and began a 200-mile walking journey to a Christian Indian village at Sault St. Louis, near Montreal.\nFor three years she grew in holiness under the direction of a priest and an older Iroquois woman, giving herself totally to God in long hours of prayer, in charity, and in strenuous penance. At 23, Kateri took a vow of virginity, an unprecedented act for an Indian woman whose future depended on being married. She found a place in the woods where she could pray an hour a day\u2014and was accused of meeting a man there!\nHer dedication to virginity was instinctive: Kateri did not know about religious life for women until she visited Montreal. Inspired by this, she and two friends wanted to start a community, but the local priest dissuaded her. She humbly accepted an \u201cordinary\u201d life. She practiced extremely severe fasting as penance for the conversion of her nation. Kateri Tekakwitha died the afternoon before Holy Thursday. Witnesses said that her emaciated face changed color and became like that of a healthy child. The lines of suffering, even the pockmarks, disappeared and the touch of a smile came upon her lips. She was beatified in 1980 and canonized in 2012.\nReflection\nWe like to think that our proposed holiness is thwarted by our situation. If only we could have more solitude, less opposition, better health. Kateri Tekakwitha repeats the example of the saints: Holiness thrives on the cross, anywhere. Yet she did have what Christians\u2014all people\u2014need: the support of a community. She had a good mother, helpful priests, Christian friends. These were present in what we call primitive conditions, and blossomed in the age-old Christian triad of prayer, fasting and almsgiving: union with God in Jesus and the Spirit, self-discipline and often suffering, and charity for her brothers and sisters.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Bonaventure\u2019s Story\nPerhaps not a household name for most people, Saint Bonaventure, nevertheless, played an important role in both the medieval Church and the history of the Franciscan Order. A senior faculty member at the University of Paris, Saint Bonaventure certainly captured the hearts of his students through his academic skills and insights. But more importantly, he captured their hearts through his Franciscan love for Jesus and the Church. Like his model, Saint Francis, Jesus was the center of everything\u2014his teaching, his administration, his writing, and his life. So much so, that he was given the title \u201cSeraphic Doctor.\u201d\nBorn in Bagnorea in 1221, Saint Bonaventure was baptized John, but received the name Bonaventure when he became a Franciscan at the age of 22. Little is known about his childhood, but we do know that his parents were Giovanni di Fidanza and Maria Ritell. It seems that his father was a physician and a man of means. While Saint Francis died about five years after the saint\u2019s birth, he is credited with healing Bonaventure as a boy of a serious illness.\nSaint Bonaventure\u2019s teaching career came to a halt when the Friars elected him to serve as their General Minister. His 17 years of service were not easy as the Order was embroiled in conflicts over the interpretation of poverty. Some friars even ended up in heresy saying that Saint Francis and his community were inaugurating the era of the Holy Spirit which was to replace Jesus, the Church, and Scripture. But because he was a man of prayer and a good administrator, Saint Bonaventure managed to structure the Order through effective legislation. But more importantly, he offered the Friars an organized spirituality based on the vision and insights of Saint Francis. Always a Franciscan at heart and a mystical writer, Bonaventure managed to unite the pastoral, practical aspects of life with the doctrines of the Church. Thus, there is a noticeable warmth to his teachings and writings that make him very appealing.\nShortly before he ended his service as General Minister, Pope Gregory X created him a Cardinal and appointed him bishop of Albano. But a little over a year later, while participating in the Second Council of Lyon, Saint Bonaventure suddenly died on July 15, 1274. There is a theory that he was poisoned.\nSaint Bonaventure left behind a structured and renewed Franciscan Order and a body of work all of which glorifies his major love\u2014Jesus.\nReflection\nBonaventure so united holiness and theological knowledge that he rose to the heights of mysticism while remaining a very active preacher and teacher, one beloved by all who met him. To know him was to love him; to read him is still for us today to meet a true Franciscan and a gentleman.\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of Our Lady of Mount Carmel\nHermits lived on Mount Carmel near the Fountain of Elijah in northern Israel in the 12th century. They had a chapel dedicated to Our Lady. By the 13th century they became known as \u201cBrothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\u201d They soon celebrated a special Mass and Office in honor of Mary. In 1726, it became a celebration of the universal Church under the title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. For centuries the Carmelites have seen themselves as specially related to Mary. Their great saints and theologians have promoted devotion to her and often championed the mystery of her Immaculate Conception.\nSaint\u00a0Teresa of Avila called Carmel \u201cthe Order of the Virgin.\u201d Saint\u00a0John of the Cross credited Mary with saving him from drowning as a child, leading him to Carmel, and helping him escape from prison. Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus believed that Mary cured her from illness. On her First Communion day, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se dedicated her life to Mary. During the last days of her life she frequently spoke of Mary.\nThere is a tradition\u2014which may not be historical\u2014that Mary appeared to Saint Simon Stock, a leader of the Carmelites, and gave him a scapular, telling him to promote devotion to it. The scapular is a modified version of Mary\u2019s own garment. It symbolizes her special protection and calls the wearers to consecrate themselves to her in a special way. The scapular reminds us of the gospel call to prayer and penance\u2014a call that Mary models in a splendid way.\nReflection\nThe Carmelites were known from early on as \u201cBrothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\u201d The title suggests that they saw Mary not only as \u201cmother,\u201d but also as \u201csister.\u201d The word sister is a reminder that Mary is very close to us. She is the daughter of God and therefore can help us be authentic daughters and sons of God. She also can help us grow in appreciation of being sisters and brothers to one another. She leads us to a new realization that all human beings belong to the family of God. When such a conviction grows, there is hope that the human race can find its way to peace.\nMary, under the Title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, is the Patron Saint of:\nChile\n\u00a0",

Perhaps it was his popularity as a student that enabled Francis in his teens to stop two duelists. He entered the Friars Minor in 1570, and after ordination enthusiastically sacrificed himself for others. His care for the sick during an epidemic drew so much admiration that he became embarrassed and asked to be sent to the African missions. Instead he was sent to South America in 1589.\nWhile working in what is now Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, Francis quickly learned the local languages and was well received by the indigenous peoples. His visits to the sick often included playing a song on his violin.\nAround 1601, he was called to Lima, Peru, where he tried to recall the Spanish colonists to their baptismal integrity. Francis also worked to defend the indigenous peoples from oppression. He died in Lima in 1610 and was canonized in 1726.\u00a0His Liturgical Feast Day is July 14.\nReflection\nFrancis Solano knew from experience that the lives of Christians sometimes greatly hinder the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

His mother died when he was a child, his father neglected him, and he grew up with an excessive love for gambling. At 17, he was afflicted with a disease of his leg that remained with him for life. In Rome he entered the San Giacomo Hospital for Incurables as both patient and servant, but was dismissed for quarrelsomeness after nine months. He served in the Venetian army for three years.\nThen in the winter of 1574, when he was 24, Camillus gambled away everything he had\u2014savings, weapons, literally down to his shirt. He accepted work at the Capuchin friary at Manfredonia, and was one day so moved by a sermon of the superior that he began a conversion that changed his life. He entered the Capuchin novitiate, but was dismissed because of the apparently incurable sore on his leg. After another stint of service at San Giacomo, he came back to the Capuchins, only to be dismissed again, for the same reason.\nAgain, back at San Giacomo, his dedication was rewarded by his being made superintendent. Camillus devoted the rest of his life to the care of the sick. Along with Saint John of God he has been named patron of hospitals, nurses, and the sick. With the advice of his friend Saint\u00a0Philip Neri, he studied for the priesthood and was ordained at the age of 34. Contrary to the advice of his friend, Camillus left San Giacomo and founded a congregation of his own. As superior, he devoted much of his own time to the care of the sick.\nCharity was his first concern, but the physical aspects of the hospital also received his diligent attention. Camillus insisted on cleanliness and the technical competence of those who served the sick. The members of his community bound themselves to serve prisoners and persons infected by the plague as well as those dying in private homes. Some of his men were with troops fighting in Hungary and Croatia in 1595, forming the first recorded military field ambulance. In Naples, he and his men went onto the galleys that had plague and were not allowed to land. He discovered that there were people being buried alive, and ordered his brothers to continue the prayers for the dying 15 minutes after apparent death.\nCamillus himself suffered the disease of his leg through his life. In his last illness, he left his own bed to see if other patients in the hospital needed help.\nReflection\nSaints are created by God. Parents must indeed nurture the faith in their children; husbands and wives must cooperate to deepen their baptismal grace; friends must support each other. But all human effort is only the dispensing of divine power. We must all try as if everything depended on us. But only the power of God can fulfill the plan of God\u2014to make us like himself.\nSaint\u00a0Camillus de Lellis is the Patron Saint of:\nHospitals\nNurses\nSick\n\u00a0",

On the contrary, she simply wanted to serve the poor wherever she found them in her native Australia. But along the way, she managed to arouse the ire of some rather powerful churchmen. One even excommunicated her for a time.\nBorn in Melbourne in 1842, to parents who had emigrated from Scotland, Mary grew up in a family that faced constant financial struggles. As a young woman she was drawn to religious life but could not find an existing order of Sisters that met her needs. In 1860, she met Father Julian Woods, who became her spiritual director. Together they founded a new community of women\u2014the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart, also known as the Josephite Sisters. Its members were to staff schools especially for poor children, as well as orphanages, and do other works of charity.\nAs the congregation grew, so did Mary MacKillop\u2019s problems. Her priest-friend proved unreliable in many ways and his responsibilities for direction of the Sisters were removed. Meanwhile, Mary had the support of some local bishops as she and her Sisters went about their work. But the bishop in South Australia, aging and relying on others for advice, briefly excommunicated Mary\u2014charging her with disobedience\u2014and dispensed 50 of her Sisters from their vows. In truth, the bishop\u2019s quarrel was about power and who had authority over whom. He ultimately rescinded his order of excommunication.\nMary insisted that her congregation should be governed by an elected mother general answerable to Rome, not to the local bishop. There also were disputes about whether or not the congregation could own property. In the end, Rome proved to be Mary\u2019s best source of support. After a long wait official approval of the congregation\u2014and how it was to be governed\u2014came from Pope Leo XIII.\nDespite her struggles with Church authorities, Mary MacKillop and her Sisters were able to offer social services that few, if any, government agencies in Australia could. They served Protestants and Catholics alike. They worked among the aborigines. They taught in schools and orphanages and served unmarried mothers.\nMoney, actually the lack of it, was a constant worry. But the Sisters who begged from door to door, were bolstered by faith and by the conviction that their struggles were opportunities to grow closer to God.\nBy the time Mary was approaching the end of her life, the congregation was thriving. She died in 1909 at the age of 67. Pope John Paul II beatified her in 1995. In 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI canonized her, she became Australia\u2019s first saint.\u00a0Her Liturgical Feast Day is August 8.\nReflection\nThe story of many foundresses of religious communities and the tales of the early days of those communities can make for fascinating reading. Those women were dedicated and tough and fought for those they served. Let\u2019s thank the Lord for raising up such wonderful examples of faith.\n",

After preaching in the area surrounding Ravenna, he entered the city again. After being cruelly tortured, he was put on a ship heading to Greece. Pagans there caused him to be expelled to Italy, where he went to Ravenna for a fourth time. He died from wounds received during a savage beating at Classis, a suburb of Ravenna. A beautiful basilica honoring him was built there in the sixth century.\nReflection\nFollowing Jesus involves risks\u2014sometimes the supreme risk of life itself.

In addition to a thorough knowledge of his native Italian, he had complete reading and speaking ability in Latin, Hebrew, Greek, German, Bohemian, Spanish, and French.\nLawrence was born on July 22, 1559, and died exactly 60 years later on his birthday in 1619. His parents William and Elizabeth Russo gave him the name of Julius Caesar, Caesare in Italian. After the early death of his parents, he was educated by his uncle at the College of St. Mark in Venice.\nWhen he was just 16, he entered the Capuchin Franciscan Order in Venice and received the name of Lawrence. He completed his studies of philosophy and theology at the University of Padua and was ordained a priest at 23.\nWith his facility for languages Lawrence was able to study the Bible in its original texts. At the request of Pope Clement VIII, he spent much time preaching to the Jews in Italy. So excellent was his knowledge of Hebrew, the rabbis felt sure he was a Jew who had become a Christian.\nLawrence\u2019s sensitivity to the needs of people\u2014a character trait perhaps unexpected in such a talented scholar\u2014began to surface. He was elected major superior of the Capuchin Franciscan province of Tuscany at the age of 31. He had the combination of brilliance, human compassion, and administrative skill needed to carry out his duties. In rapid succession he was promoted by his fellow Capuchins and was elected minister general of the Capuchins in 1602. In this position he was responsible for great growth and geographical expansion of the Order.\nLawrence was appointed papal emissary and peacemaker, a job which took him to a number of foreign countries. An effort to achieve peace in his native kingdom of Naples took him on a journey to Lisbon to visit the king of Spain. Serious illness in Lisbon took his life in 1619.\nIn 1956, the Capuchins completed a 15-volume edition of Lawrence\u2019s writings. Eleven of these 15 contain his sermons, each of which relies chiefly on scriptural quotations to illustrate his teaching.\nReflection\nHis constant devotion to Scripture, coupled with great sensitivity to the needs of people, present a lifestyle which appeals to Christians today. Lawrence had a balance in his life that blended self-discipline with a keen appreciation for the needs of those whom he was called to serve.\n",

He professed his final vows in 1853, and was ordained six years later.\nFollowing the example of the fifth-century Saint\u00a0Maron, Sharbel lived as a hermit from 1875, until his death. His reputation for holiness prompted people to seek him to receive a blessing and to be remembered in his prayers. He followed a strict fast and was very devoted to the Blessed Sacrament.

Jesus then told them they would indeed drink the cup and share his baptism of pain and death, but that sitting at his right hand or left was not his to give\u2014it \u201cis for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father\u201d (Matthew 20:23b). It remained to be seen how long it would take to realize the implications of their confident \u201cWe can!\u201d\nThe other disciples became indignant at the ambition of James and John. Then Jesus taught them all the lesson of humble service: The purpose of authority is to serve. They are not to impose their will on others, or lord it over them. This is the position of Jesus himself. He was the servant of all; the service imposed on him was the supreme sacrifice of his own life.\nOn another occasion, James and John gave evidence that the nickname Jesus gave them\u2014\u201csons of thunder\u201d\u2014was an apt one. The Samaritans would not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to hated Jerusalem. \u201cWhen the disciples James and John saw this they asked, \u2018Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?\u2019 Jesus turned and rebuked them\u2026\u201d (Luke 9:54-55).\nJames was apparently the first of the apostles to be martyred. \u201cAbout that time King Herod laid hands upon some members of the church to harm them. He had James, the brother of John, killed by the sword, and when he saw that this was pleasing to the Jews he proceeded to arrest Peter also\u201d (Acts 12:1-3a).\nThis James, sometimes called James the Greater, is not to be confused with James the Lesser or with the author of the Letter of James and the leader of the Jerusalem community.\nReflection\nThe way the Gospels treat the apostles is a good reminder of what holiness is all about. There is very little about their virtues as static possessions, entitling them to heavenly reward. Rather, the great emphasis is on the Kingdom, on God\u2019s giving them the power to proclaim the Good News. As far as their personal lives are concerned, there is much about Jesus\u2019 purifying them of narrowness, pettiness, fickleness.\nSaint James the Apostle is the Patron Saint of:\nChile\nLaborers\nNicaragua\nRheumatism\nSpain\n",

Having flunked out of the\u00a0area seminary due to his difficulty with Latin, Fr. Rother finally accepted an invitation to attend Mount St. Mary Seminary in Maryland, where he finished his studies and was approved for ordination.\nAfter serving in his local diocese for five years, Fr. Rother joined five priests, three religious sisters, and three laypersons to staff a Guatemalan mission in Santiago Atitl\u00e1n serving the Tz\u2019utujil people. The Oklahoma City diocese heard the call of Pope John XXIII to send missionaries to foreign lands, especially Central America. These twelve individuals felt the call, and with their bishop\u2019s approval, left the comforts of the United States to live and work in Guatemala.\nBy 1975, Fr. Rother was alone at his parish in Santiago Atitl\u00e1n, the others having returned home for various reasons. He served the Tz\u2019utujil people for 13 years and won their hearts and souls. Ever the farmer, and always unpretentious and mild mannered, Fr. Rother experimented with various crops as well as fulfilling his heavy pastoral duties which included as many as five Masses in four different locations on a given Sunday and as many as 1,000 baptisms a year.\nGuatemala\u2019s civil war reached the highlands and Lake Atitl\u00e1n by 1980. Government troops camped on the parish farm and Fr. Rother witnessed the assassination of a number of his parishioners, including the parish deacon.\nWarned of imminent danger, Fr. Rother returned to the United States for three months early in 1981, to visit with his family and friends. Against the advice of his family and the local bishop, Fr. Rother returned to Atitl\u00e1n to be with his people. He remembered a Sisters\u2019 community who had fled the country and later tried to return but the people asked, \u201cWhere were you when we needed you?\u201d\nOn the evening of July 28, three masked men entered the rectory and shot Fr. Rother to death. His beloved parishioners mourned him repeatedly crying, \u201cThey have killed our priest.\u201d\nPope Francis declared Stanley Rother a martyr on December 2, 2016. He was beatified in Oklahoma City on September 23, 2017.\nReflection\nThe declaration of a blessed or saint is always a celebration of the Church as the people of God. To single out an individual for his or her holiness and service builds up the entire community of faith. But this is doubly true for the Church in the United States and in Oklahoma, as one of our own is both declared a martyr for the faith and enrolled in the ranks of those declared Blessed by the Church. May the dedication, faith, and service of Blessed Stanley Rother be a source of strength for all in this country.\n",

He came to their home simply as a welcomed guest, rather than as one celebrating the conversion of a sinner like Zacchaeus or one unceremoniously received by a suspicious Pharisee. The sisters feel free to call on Jesus at their brother\u2019s death, even though a return to Judea at that time seems almost certain death.\nNo doubt Martha was an active sort of person. On one occasion, she prepares the meal for Jesus and possibly his fellow guests and forthrightly states the obvious: All hands should pitch in to help with the dinner.\nYet, as biblical scholar Father John McKenzie points out, she need not be rated as an \u201cunrecollected activist.\u201d The evangelist is emphasizing what our Lord said on several occasions about the primacy of the spiritual: \u201c\u2026[D]o not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear\u2026. But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness\u201d (Matthew 6:25b, 33a); \u201cOne does not live by bread alone\u201d (Luke 4:4b); \u201cBlessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness\u2026\u201d (Matthew 5:6a).\nMartha\u2019s great glory is her simple and strong statement of faith in Jesus after her brother\u2019s death. \u201cJesus told her, \u2018I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live, and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u2019 She said to him, \u2018Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world\u2019\u201d (John 11:25-27).\nReflection\nScripture commentators point out that in writing his account of the raising of Lazarus, Saint\u00a0John intends that we should see Martha\u2019s words to Mary before Lazarus was raised as a summons that every Christian must obey. In her saying \u201cThe teacher is here and is asking for you,\u201d Jesus is calling every one of us to resurrection\u2014now in baptismal faith, forever in sharing his victory over death. And all of us, as well as these three friends, are in our own unique way called to special friendship with him.\nSaint Martha is the Patron Saint of:\nCooks\nHousewives\nServants\nWaiters and Waitresses\n\u00a0",

At the age of 21, and after he had worked as a logger, a hospital orderly, a streetcar operator, and a prison guard, he entered St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee\u2014where he found the studies difficult. He left there, and in 1896, joined the Capuchins in Detroit, taking the name Solanus. His studies for the priesthood were again arduous.\nOn July 24, 1904, Solanus was ordained, but because his knowledge of theology was judged to be weak, he was not given permission to hear confessions or to preach. A Franciscan Capuchin who knew him well said this annoying restriction \u201cbrought forth in him a greatness and a holiness that might never have been realized in any other way.\u201d\nDuring his 14 years as porter and sacristan in Yonkers, New York, the people there recognized Solanus as a fine speaker. James Derum, his biographer writes, \u201cFor, though he was forbidden to deliver doctrinal sermons, he could give inspirational talks, or feverinos, as the Capuchins termed them.\u201d His spiritual fire deeply impressed his listeners.\nFather Solanus served at parishes in Manhattan and Harlem before returning to Detroit, where he was porter and sacristan for 20 years at St. Bonaventure Monastery. Every Wednesday afternoon he conducted well-attended services for the sick. A co-worker estimates that on the average day 150 to 200 people came to see Father Solanus in the front office. Most of them came to receive his blessing; 40 to 50 came for consultation. Many people considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings they received.\nFather Solanus\u2019 sense of God\u2019s providence inspired many of his visitors. \u201cBlessed be God in all his designs\u201d was one of his favorite expressions.\nThe many friends of Father Solanus helped the Capuchins begin a soup kitchen during the Depression. Capuchins are still feeding the hungry there today.\nIn failing health, Solanus was transferred to the Capuchin novitiate in Huntington, Indiana, in 1946,\u00a0 where he lived for ten years until needing to be hospitalized in Detroit. Father Solanus died on July 31, 1957. An estimated 20,000 people passed by his coffin before his burial in St. Bonaventure Church in Detroit.\nAt the funeral Mass, the provincial Father Gerald said: \u201cHis was a life of service and love for people like me and you. When he was not himself sick, he nevertheless suffered with and for you that were sick. When he was not physically hungry, he hungered with people like you. He had a divine love for people. He loved people for what he could do for them\u2014and for God, through them.\u201d\nIn 1960, a Father Solanus Guild was formed in Detroit to aid Capuchin seminarians. By 1967, the guild had 5,000 members\u2014many of them grateful recipients of his practical advice and his comforting assurance that God would not abandon them in their trials. Solanus Casey was declared Venerable in 1995, and beatified on November 18, 2017.\nReflection\nHis biographer James Patrick Derum writes that eventually Father Solanus was weary from bearing the burdens of the people who visited him. \u201cLong since, he had come to know the Christ-taught truth that pure love of God and one\u2019s fellowmen as children of God are in the final event all that matter. Living this truth ardently and continuously had made him, spiritually, a free man\u2014free from slavery to passions, from self-seeking, from self-indulgence, from self-pity\u2014free to serve wholly both God and man\u201d (The Porter of St. Bonaventure\u2019s, page 199).\n",

Because there were no books of romance on hand during his convalescence, Ignatius whiled away the time reading a life of Christ and lives of the saints. His conscience was deeply touched, and a long, painful turning to Christ began. Having seen the Mother of God in a vision, he made a pilgrimage to her shrine at Montserrat near Barcelona. He remained for almost a year at nearby Manresa, sometimes with the Dominicans, sometimes in a pauper\u2019s hospice, often in a cave in the hills praying. After a period of great peace of mind, he went through a harrowing trial of scruples. There was no comfort in anything\u2014prayer, fasting, sacraments, penance. At length, his peace of mind returned.\nIt was during this year of conversion that Ignatius began to write down material that later became his greatest work, the Spiritual Exercises.\nHe finally achieved his purpose of going to the Holy Land, but could not remain, as he planned, because of the hostility of the Turks. Ignatius spent the next 11 years in various European universities, studying with great difficulty, beginning almost as a child. Like many others, his orthodoxy was questioned; Ignatius was twice jailed for brief periods.\nIn 1534, at the age of 43, he and six others\u2014one of whom was Saint\u00a0Francis Xavier\u2014vowed to live in poverty and chastity and to go to the Holy Land. If this became impossible, they vowed to offer themselves to the apostolic service of the pope. The latter became the only choice. Four years later Ignatius made the association permanent. The new Society of Jesus was approved by Pope Paul III, and Ignatius was elected to serve as the first general.\nWhen companions were sent on various missions by the pope, Ignatius remained in Rome, consolidating the new venture, but still finding time to found homes for orphans, catechumens, and penitents. He founded the Roman College, intended to be the model of all other colleges of the Society.\nIgnatius was a true mystic. He centered his spiritual life on the essential foundations of Christianity\u2014the Trinity, Christ, the Eucharist. His spirituality is expressed in the Jesuit motto, Ad majorem Dei gloriam\u2014\u201cfor the greater glory of God.\u201d In his concept, obedience was to be the prominent virtue, to assure the effectiveness and mobility of his men. All activity was to be guided by a true love of the Church and unconditional obedience to the Holy Father, for which reason all professed members took a fourth vow to go wherever the pope should send them for the salvation of souls.\nReflection\nLuther nailed his theses to the church door at Wittenberg in 1517. Seventeen years later, Ignatius of Loyola founded the Society that was to play so prominent a part in the Catholic Reformation. He was an implacable foe of Protestantism. Yet the seeds of ecumenism may be found in his words: \u201cGreat care must be taken to show forth orthodox truth in such a way that if any heretics happen to be present they may have an example of charity and Christian moderation. No hard words should be used nor any sort of contempt for their errors be shown.\u201d One of the greatest ecumenists was the 20th-century German Jesuit, Cardinal Augustin Bea.\nSaint Ignatius of Loyola is the Patron Saint of:\nRetreats\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Alphonsus Liguori\u2019s Story\nMoral theology, Vatican II said, should be more thoroughly nourished by Scripture, and show the nobility of the Christian vocation of the faithful and their obligation to bring forth fruit in charity for the life of the world. Alphonsus, declared patron of moral theologians by Pius XII in 1950, would rejoice in that statement.\nIn his day, Alphonsus fought for the liberation of moral theology from the rigidity of Jansenism. His moral theology, which went through 60 editions in the century following him, concentrated on the practical and concrete problems of pastors and confessors. If a certain legalism and minimalism crept into moral theology, it should not be attributed to this model of moderation and gentleness.\nAt the University of Naples, Alphonsus received a doctorate in both canon and civil law by acclamation, at the age of 16, but he soon gave up the practice of law for apostolic activity. He was ordained a priest, and concentrated his pastoral efforts on popular parish missions, hearing confessions, and forming Christian groups.\nHe founded the Redemptorist congregation in 1732. It was an association of priests and brothers living a common life, dedicated to the imitation of Christ, and working mainly in popular missions for peasants in rural areas. Almost as an omen of what was to come later, he found himself deserted after a while by all his original companions except one lay brother. But the congregation managed to survive and was formally approved 17 years later, though its troubles were not over.\nAlphonsus\u2019 great pastoral reforms were in the pulpit and confessional\u2014replacing the pompous oratory of the time with simplicity, and the rigorism of Jansenism with kindness. His great fame as a writer has somewhat eclipsed the fact that for 26 years he traveled up and down the Kingdom of Naples preaching popular missions.\nHe was made bishop at age 66 after trying to reject the honor, and at once instituted a thorough reform of his diocese.\nHis greatest sorrow came toward the end of his life. The Redemptorists, precariously continuing after the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, had difficulty in getting their Rule approved by the Kingdom of Naples. Alphonsus acceded to the condition that they possess no property in common, but with the connivance of a high Redemptorist official, a royal official changed the Rule substantially. Alphonsus, old, crippled and with very bad sight, signed the document, unaware that he had been betrayed. The Redemptorists in the Papal States then put themselves under the pope, who withdrew those in Naples from the jurisdiction of Alphonsus. It was only after his death that the branches were united.\nAt 71, Alphonsus was afflicted with rheumatic pains which left incurable bending of his neck. Until it was straightened a little, the pressure of his chin caused a raw wound on his chest. He suffered a final 18 months of \u201cdark night\u201d scruples, fears, temptations against every article of faith and every virtue, interspersed with intervals of light and relief, when ecstasies were frequent.\nAlphonsus is best known for his moral theology, but he also wrote well in the field of spiritual and dogmatic theology. His Glories of Mary is one of the great works on that subject, and his book Visits to the Blessed Sacrament went through 40 editions in his lifetime, greatly influencing the practice of this devotion in the Church.\nReflection\nSaint\u00a0Alphonsus was known above all as a practical man who dealt in the concrete rather than the abstract. His life is indeed a practical model for the everyday Christian who has difficulty recognizing the dignity of Christian life amid the swirl of problems, pain, misunderstanding and failure. Alphonsus suffered all these things. He is a saint because he was able to maintain an intimate sense of the presence of the suffering Christ through it all.\nSaint Alphonsus Liguori is the Patron Saint of:\nTheologians\nVocations\n",

Eusebius is another of the defenders of the Church during one of its most trying periods.\nBorn on the isle of Sardinia, he became a member of the Roman clergy, and is the first recorded bishop of Vercelli in Piedmont in northwest Italy. Eusebius was also the first to link the monastic life with that of the clergy, establishing a community of his diocesan clergy on the principle that the best way to sanctify his people was to have them see a clergy formed in solid virtue and living in community.\nHe was sent by Pope Liberius to persuade the emperor to call a council to settle Catholic-Arian troubles. When it was called at Milan, Eusebius went reluctantly, sensing that the Arian block would have its way, although the Catholics were more numerous. He refused to go along with the condemnation of Saint\u00a0Athanasius; instead, he laid the Nicene Creed on the table and insisted that all sign it before taking up any other matter. The emperor put pressure on him, but Eusebius insisted on Athanasius\u2019 innocence and reminded the emperor that secular force should not be used to influence Church decisions. At first the emperor threatened to kill him, but later sent him into exile in Palestine. There the Arians dragged him through the streets and shut him up in a little room, releasing him only after his four-day hunger strike. They resumed their harassment shortly after.\nHis exile continued in Asia Minor and Egypt, until the new emperor permitted him to be welcomed back to his see in Vercelli. Eusebius attended the Council of Alexandria with Athanasius and approved the leniency shown to bishops who had wavered. He also worked with Saint\u00a0Hilary of Poitiers against the Arians.\nEusebius died peacefully in his own diocese at an advanced age.\nReflection\nCatholics in the U.S. have sometimes felt penalized by an unwarranted interpretation of the principle of separation of Church and state, especially in the matter of Catholic schools. Be that as it may, the Church is happily free today from the tremendous pressure put on it after it became an \u201cestablished\u201d Church under Constantine. We are happily rid of such things as a pope asking an emperor to call a Church council, Pope John I being sent by the emperor to negotiate in the East, or the pressure of kings on papal elections. The Church cannot be a prophet if it\u2019s in someone\u2019s pocket.\nAnother Saint of the Day for August 2 is the Dedication of the Chapel of Our Lady of the Angels.\n\u00a0",

Inspired at first by the idea of reparation for indifference to the Eucharist, Peter Julian was eventually attracted to a more positive spirituality of Christ-centered love. Members of the men\u2019s community which Peter founded alternated between an active apostolic life and contemplating Jesus in the Eucharist. He and Marguerite Guillot founded the women\u2019s Congregation of the Servants of the Blessed Sacrament.\nPeter Julian Eymard was beatified in 1925, and canonized in 1962, one day after Vatican II\u2019s first session ended.\nReflection\nIn every century, sin has been painfully real in the life of the Church. It is easy to give in to despair, to speak so strongly of human failings that people may forget the immense and self-sacrificing love of Jesus, as his death on the cross and his gift of the Eucharist make evident. Peter Julian knew that the Eucharist was key to helping Catholics live out their baptism and preach by word and example the Good News of Jesus Christ.\n\u00a0",

John Vianney was a man with vision: He wanted to become a priest. But he had to overcome his meager formal schooling, which inadequately prepared him for seminary studies.\nHis failure to comprehend Latin lectures forced him to discontinue. But his vision of being a priest urged him to seek private tutoring. After a lengthy battle with the books, John was ordained.\nSituations calling for \u201cimpossible\u201d deeds followed him everywhere. As pastor of the parish at Ars, John encountered people who were indifferent and quite comfortable with their style of living. His vision led him through severe fasts and short nights of sleep.\nWith Catherine Lassagne and Benedicta Lardet, he established La Providence, a home for girls. Only a man of vision could have such trust that God would provide for the spiritual and material needs of all those who came to make La Providence their home.\nHis work as a confessor is John Vianney\u2019s most remarkable accomplishment. In the winter months he was to spend 11 to 12 hours daily reconciling people with God. In the summer months this time was increased to 16 hours. Unless a man was dedicated to his vision of a priestly vocation, he could not have endured this giving of self day after day.\nMany people look forward to retirement and taking it easy, doing the things they always wanted to do but never had the time. But John Vianney had no thoughts of retirement. As his fame spread, more hours were consumed in serving God\u2019s people. Even the few hours he would allow himself for sleep were disturbed frequently by the devil.\nWho, but a man with vision, could keep going with ever-increasing strength? In 1929, Pope Pius XI named him the patron of parish priests worldwide.\nReflection\nIndifference toward religion, coupled with a love for material comfort, seem to be common signs of our times. A person from another planet observing us would not likely judge us to be pilgrim people, on our way to somewhere else. John Vianney on the other hand, was a man on a journey, with his goal before him at all times.\nSaint John Vianney is the Patron Saint of:\nPriests\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Dedication of Saint Mary Major Basilica\nFirst raised at the order of Pope Liberius in the mid-fourth century, the Liberian basilica was rebuilt by Pope Sixtus III shortly after the Council of Ephesus affirmed Mary\u2019s title as Mother of God in 431. Rededicated at that time to the Mother of God, St. Mary Major is the largest church in the world honoring God through Mary. Standing atop one of Rome\u2019s seven hills, the Esquiline, it has survived many restorations without losing its character as an early Roman basilica. Its interior retains three naves divided by colonnades in the style of Constantine\u2019s era. Fifth-century mosaics on its walls testify to its antiquity.\nSt. Mary Major is one of the four Roman basilicas known as patriarchal cathedrals in memory of the first centers of the Church. St. John Lateran represents Rome, the See of Peter; St. Paul Outside the Walls, the See of Alexandria, allegedly the see presided over by Mark; St. Peter\u2019s, the See of Constantinople; and St. Mary\u2019s, the See of Antioch, where Mary is supposed to have spent most of her later life.\nOne legend, unreported before the year 1000, gives another name to this feast: Our Lady of the Snows. According to that story, a wealthy Roman couple pledged their fortune to the Mother of God. In affirmation, she produced a miraculous summer snowfall and told them to build a church on the site. The legend was long celebrated by releasing a shower of white rose petals from the basilica\u2019s dome every August 5.\nReflection\nTheological debate over Christ\u2019s nature as God and man reached fever pitch in Constantinople in the early fifth century. The chaplain of Bishop Nestorius began preaching against the title Theotokos, \u201cMother of God,\u201d insisting that the Virgin was mother only of the human Jesus. Nestorius agreed, decreeing that Mary would henceforth be named \u201cMother of Christ\u201d in his see. The people of Constantinople virtually revolted against their bishop\u2019s refutation of a cherished belief. When the Council of Ephesus refuted Nestorius, believers took to the streets, enthusiastically chanting, \u201cTheotokos! Theotokos!\u201d\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Transfiguration of the Lord\nAll three Synoptic Gospels tell the story of the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-9; Luke 9:28-36). With remarkable agreement, all three place the event shortly after Peter\u2019s confession of faith that Jesus is the Messiah and Jesus\u2019 first prediction of his passion and death. Peter\u2019s eagerness to erect tents or booths on the spot suggests it occurred during the week-long Jewish Feast of Booths in the fall.\nAccording to Scripture scholars, in spite of the texts\u2019 agreement it is difficult to reconstruct the disciples\u2019 experience, because the Gospels draw heavily on Old Testament descriptions of the Sinai encounter with God, and prophetic visions of the Son of Man. Certainly Peter, James, and John had a glimpse of Jesus\u2019 divinity strong enough to strike fear into their hearts. Such an experience defies description, so they drew on familiar religious language to describe it. And certainly Jesus warned them that his glory and his suffering were to be inextricably connected\u2014a theme John highlights throughout his Gospel.\nTradition names Mount Tabor as the site of the revelation. A church first raised there in the fourth century was dedicated on August 6. A feast in honor of the Transfiguration was celebrated in the Eastern Church from about that time. Western observance began in some localities about the eighth century.\nOn July 22, 1456, Crusaders defeated the Turks at Belgrade. News of the victory reached Rome on August 6, and Pope Callistus III placed the feast on the Roman calendar the following year.\nReflection\nOne of the Transfiguration accounts is read on the second Sunday of Lent each year, proclaiming Christ\u2019s divinity to the Elect and baptized alike. The Gospel for the first Sunday of Lent, by contrast, is the story of the temptation in the desert\u2014affirmation of Jesus\u2019 humanity. The two distinct but inseparable natures of the Lord were a subject of much theological argument at the beginning of the Church\u2019s history; it remains hard for believers to grasp.\nAnother Saint of the Day for August 6 is Venerable Anthony Margil.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Cajetan\u2019s Story\nLike most of us, Cajetan seemed headed for an \u201cordinary\u201d life\u2014first as a lawyer, then as a priest engaged in the work of the Roman Curia.\nHis life took a characteristic turn when he joined the Oratory of Divine Love in Rome, a group devoted to piety and charity, shortly after his ordination at 36. When he was 42 he founded a hospital for incurables at Venice. At Vicenza, he joined a \u201cdisreputable\u201d religious community that consisted only of men of the lowest stations of life\u2014and was roundly censured by his friends, who thought his action was a reflection on his family. He sought out the sick and poor of the town and served them.\nThe greatest need of the time was the reformation of a Church that was \u201csick in head and members.\u201d Cajetan and three friends decided that the best road to reformation lay in reviving the spirit and zeal of the clergy. Together they founded a congregation known as the Theatines\u2014from Teate [Chieti] where their first superior-bishop had his see. One of the friends later became Pope Paul IV.\nThey managed to escape to Venice after their house in Rome was wrecked when Emperor Charles V\u2019s troops sacked Rome in 1527. The Theatines were outstanding among the Catholic reform movements that took shape before the Protestant Reformation. Cajetan founded a monte de pieta\u2014\u201cmountain or fund of piety\u201d\u2014in Naples, one of many charitable, nonprofit credit organizations that lent money on the security of pawned objects. The purpose was to help the poor and protect them against usurers. Cajetan\u2019s little organization ultimately became the Bank of Naples, with great changes in policy.\nReflection\nIf Vatican II had been summarily stopped after its first session in 1962, many Catholics would have felt that a great blow had been dealt to the growth of the Church. Cajetan had the same feeling about the Council of Trent, held from 1545 to 1563. But as he said, God is the same in Naples as in Venice, with or without Trent or Vatican II. We open ourselves to God\u2019s power in whatever circumstances we find ourselves, and God\u2019s will is done. God\u2019s standards of success differ from ours.\nAnother Saint of the Day for August 7 is Saint Sixtus II and Companions.\n\u00a0",

The Albigensians\u2013or Cathari, \u201cthe pure ones\u201d\u2013held to two principles\u2014one good, one evil\u2014in the world. All matter is evil\u2014hence they denied the Incarnation and the sacraments. On the same principle, they abstained from procreation and took a minimum of food and drink. The inner circle led what some people regarded as a heroic life of purity and asceticism not shared by ordinary followers.\nDominic sensed the need for the Church to combat this heresy, and was commissioned to be part of the preaching crusade against it. He saw immediately why the preaching crusade was not succeeding: the ordinary people admired and followed the ascetical heroes of the Albigenses. Understandably, they were not impressed by the Catholic preachers who traveled with horse and retinues, stayed at the best inns and had servants. Dominic therefore, with three Cistercians, began itinerant preaching according to the gospel ideal. He continued this work for 10 years, being successful with the ordinary people but not with the leaders.\nHis fellow preachers gradually became a community, and in 1215 Dominic founded a religious house at Toulouse, the beginning of the Order of Preachers or Dominicans.\nDominic\u2019s ideal, and that of his Order, was to organically link a life with God, study, and prayer in all forms, with a ministry of salvation to people by the word of God. His ideal: contemplata tradere: \u201cto pass on the fruits of contemplation\u201d or \u201cto speak only of God or with God.\u201d\nReflection\nThe Dominican ideal, like that of all religious communities, is for the imitation, not merely the admiration, of the rest of the Church. The effective combining of contemplation and activity is the vocation of truck driver Smith as well as theologian Aquinas. Acquired contemplation is the tranquil abiding in the presence of God, and is an integral part of any full human life. It must be the wellspring of all Christian activity.\nSaint Dominic is the Patron Saint of:\nAstronomers\nDominican Republic\n\u00a0",

Twelve years later she imitated Saint Teresa by becoming a Carmelite, taking the name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross.\nBorn into a prominent Jewish family in Breslau, Germany\u2014now Wroclaw, Poland\u2014Edith abandoned Judaism in her teens. As a student at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, she became fascinated by phenomenology, an approach to philosophy. Excelling as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Edmund Husserl, one of the leading phenomenologists, Edith earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1916. She continued as a university teacher until 1922 when she moved to a Dominican school in Speyer; her appointment as lecturer at the Educational Institute of Munich ended under pressure from the Nazis.\nAfter living for four years in the Cologne Carmel, Sister Teresa Benedicta moved to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, in 1938. The Nazis occupied that country in 1940. In retaliation for being denounced by the Dutch bishops, the Nazis arrested all Dutch Jews who had become Christians. Teresa Benedicta and her sister Rosa, also a Catholic, died in a gas chamber in Auschwitz on August 9, 1942.\nPope\u00a0John Paul II beatified Teresa Benedicta of the Cross in 1987, and canonized her 12 years later.\nReflection\nThe writings of Edith Stein fill 17 volumes, many of which have been translated into English.

We know very little about his life. He is one of those whose martyrdom made a deep and lasting impression on the early Church. Celebration of his feast day spread rapidly.\nHe was a Roman deacon under Pope Saint\u00a0Sixtus II. Four days after this pope was put to death, Lawrence and four clerics suffered martyrdom, probably during the persecution of the Emperor Valerian.\nLegendary details of Lawrence\u2019s death were known to Damasus, Prudentius, Ambrose, and Augustine. The church built over his tomb became one of the seven principal churches in Rome and a favorite place for Roman pilgrimages.\nA well-known legend has persisted from earliest times. As deacon in Rome, Lawrence was charged with the responsibility for the material goods of the Church, and the distribution of alms to the poor. When Lawrence knew he would be arrested like the pope, he sought out the poor, widows, and orphans of Rome and gave them all the money he had on hand, selling even the sacred vessels of the altar to increase the sum. When the prefect of Rome heard of this, he imagined that the Christians must have considerable treasure. He sent for Lawrence and said, \u201cYou Christians say we are cruel to you, but that is not what I have in mind. I am told that your priests offer in gold, that the sacred blood is received in silver cups, that you have golden candlesticks at your evening services. Now, your doctrine says you must render to Caesar what is his. Bring these treasures\u2014the emperor needs them to maintain his forces. God does not cause money to be counted: He brought none of it into the world with him\u2014only words. Give me the money, therefore, and be rich in words.\u201d\nLawrence replied that the Church was indeed rich. \u201cI will show you a valuable part. But give me time to set everything in order and make an inventory.\u201d After three days he gathered a great number of blind, lame, maimed, leprous, orphaned, and widowed persons and put them in rows. When the prefect arrived, Lawrence simply said, \u201cThese are the treasure of the Church.\u201d\nThe prefect was so angry he told Lawrence that he would indeed have his wish to die\u2014but it would be by inches. He had a great gridiron prepared with coals beneath it, and had Lawrence\u2019s body placed on it. After the martyr had suffered the pain for a long time, the legend concludes, he made his famous cheerful remark, \u201cIt is well done. Turn me over!\u201d\nReflection\nOnce again we have a saint about whom almost nothing is known, yet one who has received extraordinary honor in the Church since the fourth century. Almost nothing\u2014yet the greatest fact of his life is certain: He died for Christ. We who are hungry for details about the lives of the saints are again reminded that their holiness was after all, a total response to Christ, expressed perfectly by a death like this.\nSaint Lawrence is the Patron Saint of:\nCooks\nPoor\n\u00a0",

Having refused to marry at 15, Clare was moved by the dynamic preaching of Francis. He became her lifelong friend and spiritual guide.\nAt 18, Clare escaped from her father\u2019s home one night, was met on the road by friars carrying torches, and in the poor little chapel called the Portiuncula received a rough woolen habit, exchanged her jeweled belt for a common rope with knots in it, and sacrificed her long tresses to Francis\u2019 scissors. He placed her in a Benedictine convent, which her father and uncles immediately stormed in rage. Clare clung to the altar of the church, threw aside her veil to show her cropped hair, and remained adamant.\nSixteen days later her sister Agnes joined her. Others came. They lived a simple life of great poverty, austerity, and complete seclusion from the world, according to a Rule which Francis gave them as a Second Order. At age 21, Francis obliged Clare under obedience to accept the office of abbess, one she exercised until her death.\n\nThe Poor Ladies went barefoot, slept on the ground, ate no meat, and observed almost complete silence. Later Clare, like Francis, persuaded her sisters to moderate this rigor: \u201cOur bodies are not made of brass.\u201d The greatest emphasis, of course, was on gospel poverty. They possessed no property, even in common, subsisting on daily contributions. When even the pope tried to persuade Clare to mitigate this practice, she showed her characteristic firmness: \u201cI need to be absolved from my sins, but I do not wish to be absolved from the obligation of following Jesus Christ.\u201d\nContemporary accounts glow with admiration of Clare\u2019s life in the convent of San Damiano in Assisi. She served the sick and washed the feet of the begging nuns. She came from prayer, it was said, with her face so shining it dazzled those about her. She suffered serious illness for the last 27 years of her life. Her influence was such that popes, cardinals, and bishops often came to consult her\u2014Clare herself never left the walls of San Damiano.\nFrancis always remained her great friend and inspiration. Clare was always obedient to his will and to the great ideal of gospel life which he was making real.\nA well-known story concerns her prayer and trust. Clare had the Blessed Sacrament placed on the walls of the convent when it faced attack by invading Saracens. \u201cDoes it please you, O God, to deliver into the hands of these beasts the defenseless children I have nourished with your love? I beseech you, dear Lord, protect these whom I am now unable to protect.\u201d To her sisters she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Trust in Jesus.\u201d The Saracens fled.\nReflection\nThe 41 years of Clare\u2019s religious life are scenarios of sanctity: an indomitable resolve to lead the simple, literal gospel life as Francis taught her; courageous resistance to the ever-present pressure to dilute the ideal; a passion for poverty and humility; an ardent life of prayer; and a generous concern for her sisters.\nSaint Clare is the Patron Saint of:\nEye disorders\nTelevision\n",

Her mother died when she\u00a0was 18 months old, and her father, head of parliament at Dijon, France, became the main influence on her education. Jane\u00a0developed into a woman of beauty and refinement, lively and cheerful in temperament. At 21, she married Baron de Chantal, by whom she had six children, three of whom died in infancy. At her castle, she restored the custom of daily Mass, and was seriously engaged in various charitable works.\nJane\u2019s husband was killed after seven years of marriage, and she sank into deep dejection for four months at her family home. Her father-in-law threatened to disinherit her children if she did not return to his home. He was then 75, vain, fierce, and extravagant. Jane Frances managed to remain cheerful in spite of him and his insolent housekeeper.\nWhen she was 32, Jane met Saint\u00a0Francis de Sales who became her spiritual director, softening some of the severities imposed by her former director. She wanted to become a nun but he persuaded her to defer this decision. She took a vow to remain unmarried and to obey her director.\nAfter three years, Francis told Jane of his plan to found an institute of women that would be a haven for those whose health, age, or other considerations barred them from entering the already established communities. There would be no cloister, and they would be free to undertake spiritual and corporal works of mercy. They were primarily intended to exemplify the virtues of Mary at the Visitation\u2014hence their name the Visitation nuns\u2014humility and meekness.\nThe usual opposition to women in active ministry arose and Francis de Sales was obliged to make it a cloistered community following the Rule of Saint\u00a0Augustine. Francis wrote his famous Treatise on the Love of God for them. The congregation consisting of three women began when Jane Frances was 45. She underwent great sufferings: Francis de Sales died; her son was killed; a plague ravaged France; her daughter-in-law and son-in-law died. She encouraged the local authorities to make great efforts for the victims of the plague, and she put all her convent\u2019s resources at the disposal of the sick.\nDuring a part of her religious life, Jane Frances had to undergo great trials of the spirit\u2014interior anguish, darkness, and spiritual dryness. She died while on a visitation of convents of the community.\nReflection\nIt may strike some as unusual that a saint should be subject to spiritual dryness, darkness, interior anguish. We tend to think that such things are the usual condition of \u201cordinary\u201d sinful people. Some of our lack of spiritual liveliness may indeed be our fault. But the life of faith is still one that is lived in trust, and sometimes the darkness is so great that trust is pressed to its limit.\n\u00a0",

One had been pope for five years, the other an antipope for 18. They died reconciled.\nPontian. Pontian was a Roman who served as pope from 230 to 235. During his reign he held a synod in Alexandria which confirmed the excommunication of the great theologian Origen. Pontian was banished to exile by the Roman emperor in 235, and resigned so that a successor could be elected in Rome. He was sent to the \u201cunhealthy\u201d island of Sardinia, where he died that same year of harsh treatment. With him was Hippolytus with whom he was reconciled. The bodies of both were brought back to Rome and buried as martyrs with solemn rites.\nHippolytus. As a priest in Rome, Hippolytus\u2014the name means \u201ca horse turned loose\u201d\u2014was at first \u201cholier than the Church.\u201d He censured the pope for not coming down hard enough on a certain heresy\u2014calling him a tool in the hands of one Callistus, a deacon\u2014and coming close to advocating the opposite heresy himself. When Callistus was elected pope, Hippolytus accused him of being too lenient with penitents, and had himself elected antipope by a group of followers. He felt that the Church must be composed of pure souls uncompromisingly separated from the world: Hippolytus evidently thought that his group fitted the description. He remained in schism through the reigns of three popes. In 235, he also was banished to the island of Sardinia. Shortly before or after this event, he was reconciled to the Church, and died in exile with Pope Pontian.\nHippolytus was a rigorist, a vehement and intransigent man for whom even orthodox doctrine and practice were not purified enough. He is, nevertheless, the most important theologian and prolific religious writer before the age of Constantine. His writings are the fullest source of our knowledge of the Roman liturgy and the structure of the Church in the second and third centuries. His works include many Scripture commentaries, polemics against heresies, and a history of the world. A marble statue dating from the third century, representing the saint sitting in a chair, was found in 1551. On one side is inscribed his table for computing the date of Easter; on the other, a list of how the system works out until the year 224. Pope John XXIII installed the statue in the Vatican library.\nReflection\nHippolytus was a strong defender of orthodoxy, and admitted his excesses by his humble reconciliation. He was not a formal heretic, but an overzealous disciplinarian. What he could not learn in his prime as a reformer and purist, he learned in the pain and desolation of imprisonment. It was a fitting symbolic event that Pope Pontian shared his martyrdom.\n\u00a0",

She asked if I would like to have them\u2014one was for purity, the other for martyrdom. I said, \u2018I choose both.\u2019 She smiled and disappeared.\u201d After that he was not the same.\nHe entered the minor seminary of the Conventual Franciscans in Lv\u00edv\u2013then Poland, now Ukraine\u2013 near his birthplace, and at 16 became a novice. Though Maximilian later achieved doctorates in philosophy and theology, he was deeply interested in science, even drawing plans for rocket ships.\nOrdained at 24, Maximilian saw religious indifference as the deadliest poison of the day. His mission was to combat it. He had already founded the Militia of the Immaculata, whose aim was to fight evil with the witness of the good life, prayer, work, and suffering. He dreamed of and then founded Knight of the Immaculata, a religious magazine under Mary\u2019s protection to preach the Good News to all nations. For the work of publication he established a \u201cCity of the Immaculata\u201d\u2014Niepokalanow\u2014which housed 700 of his Franciscan brothers. He later founded another one in Nagasaki, Japan. Both the Militia and the magazine ultimately reached the one-million mark in members and subscribers. His love of God was daily filtered through devotion to Mary.\nIn 1939, the Nazi panzers overran Poland with deadly speed. Niepokalanow was severely bombed. Kolbe and his friars were arrested, then released in less than three months, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception.\nIn 1941, Fr. Kolbe was arrested again. The Nazis\u2019 purpose was to liquidate the select ones, the leaders. The end came quickly, three months later in Auschwitz, after terrible beatings and humiliations.\nA prisoner had escaped. The commandant announced that 10 men would die. He relished walking along the ranks. \u201cThis one. That one.\u201d\nAs they were being marched away to the starvation bunkers, Number 16670 dared to step from the line.\n\u201cI would like to take that man\u2019s place. He has a wife and children.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cA priest.\u201d\nNo name, no mention of fame. Silence. The commandant, dumbfounded, perhaps with a fleeting thought of history, kicked Sergeant Francis Gajowniczek out of line and ordered Fr. Kolbe to go with the nine. In the \u201cblock of death\u201d they were ordered to strip naked, and their slow starvation began in darkness. But there was no screaming\u2014the prisoners sang. By the eve of the Assumption, four were left alive. The jailer came to finish Kolbe off as he sat in a corner praying. He lifted his fleshless arm to receive the bite of the hypodermic needle. It was filled with carbolic acid. They burned his body with all the others. Fr. Kolbe was beatified in 1971 and canonized in 1982.\nReflection\nFather Kolbe\u2019s death was not a sudden, last-minute act of heroism. His whole life had been a preparation. His holiness was a limitless, passionate desire to convert the whole world to God. And his beloved Immaculata was his inspiration.\nSaint\u00a0Maximilian Mary Kolbe is the Patron Saint of:\nAddicts\nDrug addiction\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary\nOn November 1, 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary to be a dogma of faith: \u201cWe pronounce, declare and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma that the immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul to heavenly glory.\u201d The pope proclaimed this dogma only after a broad consultation of bishops, theologians and laity. There were few dissenting voices. What the pope solemnly declared was already a common belief in the Catholic Church.\nWe find homilies on the Assumption going back to the sixth century. In following centuries, the Eastern Churches held steadily to the doctrine, but some authors in the West were hesitant. However by the 13th century there was universal agreement. The feast was celebrated under various names\u2014Commemoration, Dormition, Passing, Assumption\u2014from at least the fifth or sixth century. Today it is celebrated as a solemnity.\nScripture does not give an account of Mary\u2019s Assumption into heaven. Nevertheless, Revelation 12 speaks of a woman who is caught up in the battle between good and evil. Many see this woman as God\u2019s people. Since Mary best embodies the people of both Old and New Testaments, her Assumption can be seen as an exemplification of the woman\u2019s victory.\nFurthermore, in 1 Corinthians 15:20, Paul speaks of Christ\u2019s resurrection as the first fruits\u00a0of those who have fallen asleep.\nSince Mary is closely associated with all the mysteries of Jesus\u2019 life, it is not surprising that the Holy Spirit has led the Church to believe in Mary\u2019s share in his glorification. So close was she to Jesus on earth, she must be with him body and soul in heaven.\nReflection\nIn the light of the Assumption of Mary, it is easy to pray her Magnificat (Luke 1:46\u201355) with new meaning. In her glory she proclaims the greatness of the Lord and finds joy in God her savior. God has done marvels to her and she leads others to recognize God\u2019s holiness. She is the lowly handmaid who deeply reverenced her God and has been raised to the heights. From her position of strength she will help the lowly and the poor find justice on earth, and she will challenge the rich and powerful to distrust wealth and power as a source of happiness.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Stephen of Hungary\u2019s Story\nThe Church is universal, but its expression is always affected\u2014for good or ill\u2014by local culture. There are no \u201cgeneric\u201d Christians; there are Mexican Christians, Polish Christians, Filipino Christians. This fact is evident in the life of Stephen, national hero and spiritual patron of Hungary.\nBorn a pagan, he was baptized around the age of 10, together with his father, chief of the Magyars, a group who migrated to the Danube area in the ninth century. At 20, he married Gisela, sister to the future emperor, Saint Henry. When he succeeded his father, Stephen adopted a policy of Christianization of the country for both political and religious reasons. He suppressed a series of revolts by pagan nobles and welded the Magyars into a strong national group. He asked the pope to provide for the Church\u2019s organization in Hungary\u2014and also requested that the pope confer the title of king upon him. He was crowned on Christmas day in 1001.\nStephen established a system of tithes to support churches and pastors and to relieve the poor. Out of every 10 towns one had to build a church and support a priest. He abolished pagan customs with a certain amount of violence, and commanded all to marry, except clergy and religious. He was easily accessible to all, especially the poor.\nIn 1031, his son Emeric died, and the rest of Stephen\u2019s days were embittered by controversy over his successor. His nephews attempted to kill him. He died in 1038 and was canonized, along with his son, in 1083.\nReflection\nGod\u2019s gift of holiness is a Christlike love of God and humanity. Love must sometimes bear a stern countenance for the sake of ultimate good. Christ attacked hypocrites among the Pharisees, but died forgiving them. Paul excommunicated the incestuous man at Corinth \u201cthat his spirit may be saved.\u201d Some Christians fought the Crusades with noble zeal, in spite of the unworthy motives of others.\nToday, after senseless wars, and with a deeper understanding of the complex nature of human motives, we shrink from any use of violence\u2014physical or \u201csilent.\u201d This wholesome development continues as people debate whether it is possible for a Christian to be an absolute pacifist or whether evil must sometimes be repelled by force.\nSaint Stephen of Hungary is the Patron Saint of:\nBricklayers\nHungary\n",

After her parents\u2019 death she took over the shop. She quickly became known for her greediness and insensitivity to the beggars who often came seeking help.\nThat was until she was touched by the strange woman who claimed she was on intimate terms with the deity. Joan, who had always been devout, even scrupulous, became a new person. She began caring for needy children. Then the poor, elderly, and sick came to her. Over time, she closed the family business so she could devote herself fully to good works and penance.\nShe went on to found what came to be known as the Congregation of Saint\u00a0Anne of Providence. It was then she took the religious name of Joan of the Cross. By the time of her death in 1736 she had founded 12 religious houses, hospices, and schools.

Louis was related to Saint\u00a0Louis IX on his father\u2019s side and to Elizabeth of Hungary on his mother\u2019s side.\nLouis showed early signs of attachment to prayer and to the corporal works of mercy. As a child he used to take food from the castle to feed the poor. When he was 14, Louis and two of his brothers were taken as hostages to the king of Aragon\u2019s court as part of a political deal involving Louis\u2019s father. At the court, Louis was tutored by Franciscan friars under whom he made great progress both in his studies and in the spiritual life. Like Saint\u00a0Francis he developed a special love for those afflicted with leprosy.\nWhile he was still a hostage, Louis decided to renounce his royal title and become a priest. When he was 20, he was allowed to leave the king of Aragon\u2019s court. He renounced his title in favor of his brother Robert and was ordained the next year. Very shortly after, he was appointed bishop of Toulouse, but the pope agreed to Louis\u2019s request to become a Franciscan first.\nThe Franciscan spirit pervaded Louis. \u201cJesus Christ is all my riches; he alone is sufficient for me,\u201d Louis kept repeating. Even as a bishop he wore the Franciscan habit and sometimes begged. He assigned a friar to offer him correction\u2014in public if necessary\u2014and the friar did his job.\nLouis\u2019s service to the Diocese of Toulouse was richly blessed. In no time he was considered a saint. Louis set aside 75 percent of his income as bishop to feed the poor and maintain churches. Each day he fed 25 poor people at his table.\nLouis was canonized in 1317 by Pope John XXII, one of his former teachers. His\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is August 19.\nReflection\nWhen Cardinal Hugolino, the future Pope Gregory IX, suggested to Francis that some of the friars would make fine bishops, Francis protested that they might lose some of their humility and simplicity if appointed to those positions. Those two virtues are needed everywhere in the Church, and Louis shows us how they can be lived out by bishops.",

Born on a farm in northern France, John died at 79 in the next \u201ccounty\u201d or department. In that time, he was a religious, a parish missionary, founder of two religious communities, and a great promoter of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\nJohn joined the religious community of the Oratorians and was ordained a priest at 24. During severe plagues in 1627 and 1631, he volunteered to care for the stricken in his own diocese. Lest he infect his fellow religious, during the plague he lived in a huge cask in the middle of a field.\nAt age 32, John became a parish missionary. His gifts as a preacher and confessor won him great popularity. He preached over 100 parish missions, some lasting from several weeks to several months.\nIn his concern with the spiritual improvement of the clergy, John realized that the greatest need was for seminaries. He had permission from his general superior, the bishop, and even Cardinal Richelieu to begin this work, but the succeeding general superior disapproved. After prayer and counsel, John decided it was best to leave the religious community.\nThat same year John founded a new community, ultimately called the Eudists\u2014the Congregation of Jesus and Mary\u2013devoted to the formation of the clergy by conducting diocesan seminaries. The new venture, while approved by individual bishops, met with immediate opposition, especially from Jansenists and some of his former associates. John founded several seminaries in Normandy, but was unable to get approval from Rome\u2014partly, it was said, because he did not use the most tactful approach.\nIn his parish mission work, John was disturbed by the sad condition of prostitutes who sought to escape their miserable life. Temporary shelters were found, but arrangements were not satisfactory. A certain Madeleine Lamy, who had cared for several of the women, one day said to him, \u201cWhere are you off to now? To some church, I suppose, where you\u2019ll gaze at the images and think yourself pious. And all the time what is really wanted of you is a decent house for these poor creatures.\u201d The words, and the laughter of those present, struck deeply within him. The result was another new religious community, called the Sisters of Charity of the Refuge.\nJohn Eudes is probably best known for the central theme of his writings: Jesus as the source of holiness; Mary as the model of the Christian life. His devotion to the Sacred Heart and to the Immaculate Heart led Pope Pius XI to declare him the father of the liturgical cult of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.\nReflection\nHoliness is the wholehearted openness to the love of God. It is visibly expressed in many ways, but the variety of expression has one common quality: concern for the needs of others. In John\u2019s case, those who were in need were plague-stricken people, ordinary parishioners, those preparing for the priesthood, prostitutes, and all Christians called to imitate the love of Jesus and his mother.\n",

But Western Europe\u2019s \u201cman of the twelfth century,\u201d without doubt or controversy, had to be Bernard of Clairvaux. Adviser of popes, preacher of the Second Crusade, defender of the faith, healer of a schism, reformer of a monastic Order, Scripture scholar, theologian, and eloquent preacher: any one of these titles would distinguish an ordinary man. Yet Bernard was all of these\u2014and he still retained a burning desire to return to the hidden monastic life of his younger days.\nIn the year 1111, at the age of 20, Bernard left his home to join the monastic community of Citeaux. His five brothers, two uncles, and some 30 young friends followed him into the monastery. Within four years, a dying community had recovered enough vitality to establish a new house in the nearby valley of Wormwoods, with Bernard as abbot. The zealous young man was quite demanding, though more on himself than others. A slight breakdown of health taught him to be more patient and understanding. The valley was soon renamed Clairvaux, the valley of light.\nHis ability as arbitrator and counselor became widely known. More and more he was lured away from the monastery to settle long-standing disputes. On several of these occasions, he apparently stepped on some sensitive toes in Rome. Bernard was completely dedicated to the primacy of the Roman See. But to a letter of warning from Rome, he replied that the good fathers in Rome had enough to do to keep the Church in one piece. If any matters arose that warranted their interest, he would be the first to let them know.\nShortly thereafter it was Bernard who intervened in a full-blown schism and settled it in favor of the Roman pontiff against the antipope.\nThe Holy See prevailed on Bernard to preach the Second Crusade throughout Europe. His eloquence was so overwhelming that a great army was assembled and the success of the crusade seemed assured. The ideals of the men and their leaders, however, were not those of Abbot Bernard, and the project ended as a complete military and moral disaster.\nBernard felt responsible in some way for the degenerative effects of the crusade. This heavy burden possibly hastened his death, which came August 20, 1153.\nReflection\nBernard\u2019s life in the Church was more active than we can imagine possible today. His efforts produced far-reaching results. But he knew that they would have availed little without the many hours of prayer and contemplation that brought him strength and heavenly direction. His life was characterized by a deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. His sermons and books about Mary are still the standard of Marian theology.\n",

He was one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest popes.\nEver mindful of his humble origin, Pope Pius stated, \u201cI was born poor, I lived poor, I will die poor.\u201d He was embarrassed by some of the pomp of the papal court. \u201cLook how they have dressed me up,\u201d he said in tears to an old friend. To another, \u201cIt is a penance to be forced to accept all these practices. They lead me around surrounded by soldiers like Jesus when he was seized in Gethsemani.\u201d\nInterested in politics, Pope Pius encouraged Italian Catholics to become more politically involved. One of his first papal acts was to end the supposed right of governments to interfere by veto in papal elections\u2014a practice that reduced the freedom of the 1903 conclave which had elected him.\nIn 1905, when France renounced its agreement with the Holy See and threatened confiscation of Church property if governmental control of Church affairs were not granted, Pius X courageously rejected the demand.\nWhile he did not author a famous social encyclical as his predecessor had done, he denounced the ill treatment of indigenous peoples on the plantations of Peru, sent a relief commission to Messina after an earthquake, and sheltered refugees at his own expense.\nOn the 11th anniversary of his election as pope, Europe was plunged into World War I. Pius had foreseen it, but it killed him. \u201cThis is the last affliction the Lord will visit on me. I would gladly give my life to save my poor children from this ghastly scourge.\u201d He died a few weeks after the war began, and was canonized in 1954.\nReflection\nHis humble background was no obstacle in relating to a personal God and to people whom he loved genuinely. Pius X gained his strength, his gentleness and warmth for people from the source of all gifts, the Spirit of Jesus. In contrast, we often feel embarrassed by our backgrounds. Shame makes us prefer to remain aloof from people whom we perceive as superior. If we are in a superior position, on the other hand, we often ignore simpler people. Yet we, too, have to help \u201crestore all things in Christ,\u201d especially the wounded people of God.\n\u00a0",

Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: \u201cHail, Holy Queen,\u201d \u201cHail, Queen of Heaven,\u201d \u201cQueen of Heaven.\u201d The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown as well as numerous invocations in Mary\u2019s litany celebrate her queenship.\nThe feast is a logical follow-up to the Assumption, and is now celebrated on the octave day of that feast. In his 1954 encyclical To the Queen of Heaven, Pius XII points out that Mary deserves the title because she is Mother of God, because she is closely associated as the New Eve with Jesus\u2019 redemptive work, because of her preeminent perfection, and because of her intercessory power.\nReflection\nAs Saint\u00a0Paul suggests in Romans 8:28\u201330, God has predestined human beings from all eternity to share the image of his Son. All the more was Mary predestined to be the mother of Jesus. As Jesus was to be king of all creation, Mary, in dependence on Jesus, was to be queen. All other titles to queenship derive from this eternal intention of God. As Jesus exercised his kingship on earth by serving his Father and his fellow human beings, so did Mary exercise her queenship. As the glorified Jesus remains with us as our king till the end of time (Matthew 28:20), so does Mary, who was assumed into heaven and crowned queen of heaven and earth.\n",

        "about": "\nSaint Rose of Lima\u2019s Story\nThe first canonized saint of the New World has one characteristic of all saints\u2014the suffering of opposition\u2014and another characteristic which is more for admiration than for imitation\u2014excessive practice of mortification.\nShe was born to parents of Spanish descent in Lima, Peru, at a time when South America was in its first century of evangelization. She seems to have taken Catherine of Siena as a model, in spite of the objections and ridicule of parents and friends.\nThe saints have so great a love of God that what seems bizarre to us, and is indeed sometimes imprudent, is simply a logical carrying out of a conviction that anything that might endanger a loving relationship with God must be rooted out. So, because her beauty was so often admired, Rose used to rub her face with pepper to produce disfiguring blotches. Later, she wore a thick circlet of silver on her head, studded on the inside, like a crown of thorns.\nWhen her parents fell into financial trouble, she worked in the garden all day and sewed at night. Ten years of struggle against her parents began when they tried to make Rose marry. They refused to let her enter a convent, and out of obedience she continued her life of penance and solitude at home as a member of the Third Order of Saint\u00a0Dominic. So deep was her desire to live the life of Christ that she spent most of her time at home in solitude.\nDuring the last few years of her life, Rose set up a room in the house where she cared for homeless children, the elderly, and the sick. This was a beginning of social services in Peru. Though secluded in life and activity, she was brought to the attention of Inquisition interrogators, who could only say that she was influenced by grace.\nWhat might have been a merely eccentric life was transfigured from the inside. If we remember some unusual penances, we should also remember the greatest thing about Rose: a love of God so ardent that it withstood ridicule from without, violent temptation, and lengthy periods of sickness. When she died at 31, the city turned out for her funeral. Prominent men took turns carrying her coffin.\nReflection\nIt is easy to dismiss excessive penances of the saints as the expression of a certain culture or temperament. But a woman wearing a crown of thorns may at least prod our consciences. We enjoy the most comfort-oriented life in human history. We eat too much, drink too much, use a million gadgets, fill our eyes and ears with everything imaginable. Commerce thrives on creating useless needs on which to spend our money. It seems that when we have become most like slaves, there is the greatest talk of \u201cfreedom.\u201d Are we willing to discipline ourselves in such an atmosphere?\nSaint Rose of Lima is the Patron Saint of:\nAmericas\nFlorists\nLatin America\nPeru\nPhilippines\nSouth America\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Bartholomew\u2019s Story\nIn the New Testament, Bartholomew is mentioned only in the lists of the apostles. Some scholars identify him with Nathanael, a man of Cana in Galilee who was summoned to Jesus by Philip. Jesus paid him a great compliment: \u201cHere is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him\u201d (John 1:47b). When Nathanael asked how Jesus knew him, Jesus said, \u201cI saw you under the fig tree\u201d (John 1:48b). Whatever amazing revelation this involved, it brought Nathanael to exclaim, \u201cRabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel\u201d (John 1:49b). But Jesus countered with, \u201cDo you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this\u201d (John 1:50b).\nNathanael did see greater things. He was one of those to whom Jesus appeared on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection (see John 21:1-14). They had been fishing all night without success. In the morning, they saw someone standing on the shore though no one knew it was Jesus. He told them to cast their net again, and they made so great a catch that they could not haul the net in. Then John cried out to Peter, \u201cIt is the Lord.\u201d\nWhen they brought the boat to shore, they found a fire burning, with some fish laid on it and some bread. Jesus asked them to bring some of the fish they had caught, and invited them to come and eat their meal. John relates that although they knew it was Jesus, none of the apostles presumed to inquire who he was. This, John notes, was the third time Jesus appeared to the apostles.\nReflection\nBartholomew or Nathanael? We are confronted again with the fact that we know almost nothing about most of the apostles. Yet the unknown ones were also foundation stones, the 12 pillars of the new Israel whose 12 tribes now encompass the whole earth. Their personalities were secondary\u2014without thereby being demeaned\u2014to their great office of bearing tradition from their firsthand experience, speaking in the name of Jesus, putting the Word Made Flesh into human words for the enlightenment of the world. Their holiness was not an introverted contemplation of their status before God. It was a gift that they had to share with others. The Good News was that all are called to the holiness of being Christ\u2019s members, by the gracious gift of God.\nThe simple fact is that humanity is totally meaningless unless God is its total concern. Then humanity, made holy with God\u2019s own holiness, becomes the most precious creation of God.\nSaint Bartholomew is the Patron Saint of:\nPlasterers\n",

Other kings had done the same, of course. Louis was different in that he actually interpreted his kingly duties in the light of faith. After the violence of two previous reigns, he brought peace and justice.\nLouis \u201ctook the cross\u201d for a Crusade when he was 30. His army seized Damietta in Egypt but not long after, weakened by dysentery and without support, they were surrounded and captured. Louis obtained the release of the army by giving up the city of Damietta in addition to paying a ransom. He stayed in Syria four years.\nLouis deserves credit for extending justice in civil administration. His regulations for royal officials became the first of a series of reform laws. He replaced trial by battle with a form of examination of witnesses and encouraged the use of written records in court.\nLouis was always respectful of the papacy, but defended royal interests against the popes, and refused to acknowledge Innocent IV\u2019s sentence against Emperor Frederick II.\nLouis was devoted to his people, founding hospitals, visiting the sick, and like his patron Saint\u00a0Francis, caring even for people with leprosy. He is one of the patrons of the Secular Franciscan Order. Louis united France\u2014lords and townsfolk, peasants and priests and knights\u2014by the force of his personality and holiness. For many years the nation was at peace.\nEvery day, Louis had 13 special guests from among the poor to eat with him, and a large number of poor were served meals near his palace. During Advent and Lent, all who presented themselves were given a meal, and Louis often served them in person. He kept lists of needy people, whom he regularly relieved, in every province of his dominion.\nDisturbed by new Muslim advances in Syria, he led another crusade in 1267, at the age of 41. His crusade was diverted to Tunis for his brother\u2019s sake. The army was decimated by disease within a month, and Louis himself died on foreign soil at the age of 56. He was canonized 27 years later.\nReflection\nLouis was strong-willed, strong-minded. His word was trusted utterly, and his courage in action was remarkable. What is most remarkable was his sense of respect for anyone with whom he dealt, especially the \u201chumble folk of the Lord.\u201d To care for his people he built cathedrals, churches, libraries, hospitals and orphanages. He dealt with princes honestly and equitably. He hoped to be treated the same way by the King of Kings, to whom he gave his life, his family and his country.\nSaint Louis of France is the Patron Saint of:\nBarbers\nGrooms\nSecular Franciscan Order\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Joseph Calasanz\u2019 Story\nFrom Aragon, where he was born in 1556, to Rome, where he died 92 years later, fortune alternately smiled and frowned on the work of Joseph Calasanz. A priest with university training in canon law and theology, respected for his wisdom and administrative expertise, he put aside his career because he was deeply concerned with the need for education of poor children.\nWhen he was unable to get other institutes to undertake this apostolate at Rome, Joseph and several companions personally provided a free school for deprived children. So overwhelming was the response that there was a constant need for larger facilities to house their effort. Soon, Pope Clement VIII gave support to the school, and this aid continued under Pope Paul V. Other schools were opened; other men were attracted to the work, and in 1621 the community\u2014for so the teachers lived\u2014was recognized as a religious community, the Clerks Regular of Religious Schools\u2014Piarists or Scolopi. Not long after, Joseph was appointed superior for life.\nA combination of various prejudices and political ambition and maneuvering caused the institute much turmoil. Some did not favor educating the poor, for education would leave the poor dissatisfied with their lowly tasks for society! Others were shocked that some of the Piarists were sent for instruction to Galileo\u2014a friend of Joseph\u2014as superior, thus dividing the members into opposite camps. Repeatedly investigated by papal commissions, Joseph was demoted; when the struggle within the institute persisted, the Piarists were suppressed. Only after Joseph\u2019s death were they formally recognized as a religious community. His Liturgical Feast Day is August 25.\nReflection\nNo one knew better than Joseph the need for the work he was doing; no one knew better than he how baseless were the charges brought against him. Yet if he were to work within the Church, he realized that he must submit to its authority, that he must accept a setback if he was unable to convince authorized investigators. While the prejudice, the scheming and the ignorance of men often keep the truth from emerging for a long period of time, Joseph was convinced, even under suppression, that his institute would again be recognized and authorized. With this trust he joined exceptional patience and a genuine spirit of forgiveness.",

Although she was a Christian, her parents gave her in marriage to a pagan, Patricius, who lived in her hometown of Tagaste in North Africa. Patricius had some redeeming features, but he had a violent temper and was licentious. Monica also had to bear with a cantankerous mother-in-law who lived in her home. Patricius criticized his wife because of her charity and piety, but always respected her. Monica\u2019s prayers and example finally won her husband and mother-in-law to Christianity. Her husband died in 371, one year after his baptism.\nMonica had at least three children who survived infancy. The oldest, Augustine, is the most famous. At the time of his father\u2019s death, Augustine was 17 and a rhetoric student in Carthage. Monica was distressed to learn that her son had accepted the Manichean heresy\u2014\u201dall flesh is evil\u201d\u2014and was living an immoral life. For a while, she refused to let him eat or sleep in her house. Then one night she had a vision that assured her Augustine would return to the faith. From that time on, she stayed close to her son, praying and fasting for him. In fact she often stayed much closer than Augustine wanted.\nWhen he was 29, Augustine decided to go to Rome to teach rhetoric. Monica was determined to go along. One night he told his mother that he was going to the dock to say goodbye to a friend. Instead he set sail for Rome. Monica was heartbroken when she learned of Augustine\u2019s trick, but she still followed him. She arrived in Rome only to find that he had left for Milan. Although travel was difficult, Monica pursued him to Milan.\nIn Milan, Augustine came under the influence of the bishop, Saint Ambrose, who also became Monica\u2019s spiritual director. She accepted his advice in everything and had the humility to give up some practices that had become second nature to her. Monica became a leader of the devout women in Milan as she had been in Tagaste.\nShe continued her prayers for Augustine during his years of instruction. At Easter 387, Saint Ambrose baptized Augustine and several of his friends. Soon after, his party left for Africa. Although no one else was aware of it, Monica knew her life was near the end. She told Augustine, \u201cSon, nothing in this world now affords me delight. I do not know what there is now left for me to do or why I am still here, all my hopes in this world being now fulfilled.\u201d She became ill shortly after and suffered severely for nine days before her death.\nAlmost all we know about St. Monica is in the writings of Saint Augustine, especially his Confessions.\nReflection\nToday, with Google searches, online shopping, text messages, tweets, and instant credit, we have little patience for things that take time. Likewise, we want instant answers to our prayers. Monica is a model of patience. Her long years of prayer, coupled with a strong, well-disciplined character, finally led to the conversion of her hot-tempered husband, her cantankerous mother-in-law and her brilliant but wayward son, Augustine.\nSaint Monica is the Patron Saint of:\nAlcoholics\nConversion\nMarried Women\nMothers\n",

The tears of his mother, the instructions of Ambrose and, most of all, God himself speaking to him in the Scriptures, redirected Augustine\u2019s love of life to a life of love.\nHaving been so deeply immersed in creature-pride of life in his early days and having drunk deeply of its bitter dregs, it is not surprising that Augustine should have turned, with a holy fierceness, against the many demon-thrusts rampant in his day. His times were truly decadent: politically, socially, morally. He was both feared and loved, like the Master. The perennial criticism leveled against him: a fundamental rigorism.\nIn his day, Augustine providentially fulfilled the office of prophet. Like Jeremiah and other greats, he was hard-pressed but could not keep quiet. \u201cI say to myself, I will not mention him/I will speak in his name no more/But then it becomes like fire burning in my heart/imprisoned in my bones/I grow weary holding it in/I cannot endure it\u201d (Jeremiah 20:9).\nReflection\nAugustine is still acclaimed and condemned in our day.

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Martyrdom of John the Baptist\nThe drunken oath of a king with a shallow sense of honor, a seductive dance and the hateful heart of a queen combined to bring about the martyrdom of John the Baptist. The greatest of prophets suffered the fate of so many Old Testament prophets before him: rejection and martyrdom. The \u201cvoice crying in the desert\u201d did not hesitate to accuse the guilty, did not hesitate to speak the truth. But why? What possesses a man that he would give up his very life?\nThis great religious reformer was sent by God to prepare the people for the Messiah. His vocation was one of selfless giving. The only power that he claimed was the Spirit of Yahweh. \u201cI am baptizing you with water, for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is mightier than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire\u201d (Matthew 3:11).\nScripture tells us that many people followed John looking to him for hope, perhaps in anticipation of some great messianic power. John never allowed himself the false honor of receiving these people for his own glory. He knew his calling was one of preparation. When the time came, he led his disciples to Jesus: \u201cThe next day John was there again with two of his disciples, and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, \u2018Behold, the Lamb of God.\u2019 The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus\u201d (John 1:35-37).\nIt is John the Baptist who has pointed the way to Christ. John\u2019s life and death were a giving over of self for God and other people. His simple style of life was one of complete detachment from earthly possessions. His heart was centered on God and the call that he heard from the Spirit of God speaking to his heart. Confident of God\u2019s grace, he had the courage to speak words of condemnation, repentance, and salvation.\nReflection\nEach of us has a calling to which we must listen. No one will ever repeat the mission of John, and yet all of us are called to that very mission. It is the role of the Christian to witness to Jesus. Whatever our position in this world, we are called to be disciples of Christ. By our words and deeds, others should realize that we live in the joy of knowing that Jesus is Lord. We do not have to depend upon our own limited resources, but can draw strength from the vastness of Christ\u2019s saving grace.\n",

Her widowed mother was hard pressed to raise her eight children alone; four died young. At the age of 15 or 16, Jeanne became a kitchen maid for a family that not only cared for its own members, but also served poor, elderly people nearby. Ten years later, Jeanne became a nurse at the hospital in Le Rosais. Soon thereafter, she joined a third order group founded by Saint\u00a0John Eudes.\nAfter six years she became a servant and friend of a woman she met through the third order. They prayed, visited the poor, and taught catechism to children. After her friend\u2019s death, Jeanne and two other women continued a similar life in the city of Saint-Sevran. In 1839, they brought in their first permanent guest. They began an association, received more members, and more guests. M\u00e8re Marie of the Cross, as Jeanne was now known, founded six more houses for the elderly by the end of 1849, all staffed by members of her association\u2014the Little Sisters of the Poor. By 1853, the association numbered 500 and had houses as far away as England.\nAbb\u00e9 Le Pailleur, a chaplain, had prevented Jeanne\u2019s reelection as superior in 1843; nine years later, he had her assigned to duties within the congregation, but would not allow her to be recognized as its founder. In 1890, the Holy See removed him from office.\nBy the time Pope Leo XIII gave her final approval to the community\u2019s constitutions in 1879, there were 2,400 Little Sisters of the Poor. Jeanne died later that same year, on August 30. Her cause was introduced in Rome in 1970. She was beatified in 1982, and canonized in 2009.\nReflection\nJeanne Jugan saw Christ in what Saint Teresa of Calcutta would describe as his \u201cdistressing disguises.\u201d With great confidence in God\u2019s providence and the intercession of Saint\u00a0Joseph, she begged willingly for the many homes that she opened, relying on the good example of the Sisters and the generosity of benefactors who knew the good that the Sisters were doing. They now work in 30 countries. \u201cWith the eye of faith, we must see Jesus in our old people\u2014for they are God\u2019s mouthpiece,\u201d Jeanne once said. No matter what the difficulties, she was always able to praise God and move ahead.\n",

Following the death of Jesus, Joseph obtained Jesus\u2019 body from Pilate, wrapped it in fine linen and buried it.

Her autobiography, The Story of a Soul, is read and loved throughout the world. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Martin entered the convent at the age of 15 and died in 1897 at the age of 24.\nLife in a Carmelite convent is indeed uneventful and consists mainly of prayer and hard domestic work. But Th\u00e9r\u00e8se possessed that holy insight that redeems the time, however dull that time may be. She saw in quiet suffering a redemptive suffering, suffering that was indeed her apostolate. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se said she came to the Carmel convent \u201cto save souls and pray for priests.\u201d And shortly before she died, she wrote: \u201cI want to spend my heaven doing good on earth.\u201d\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se was canonized in 1925.\u00a0On October 19, 1997, Pope John Paul II proclaimed her a Doctor of the Church, the third woman to be so recognized in light of her holiness and the influence of her teaching on spirituality in the Church.\nHer parents, Louis and Z\u00e9lie, were beatified in 2008, and canonized in 2015.\nReflection\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se has much to teach our age of the image, the appearance, the \u201cself.\u201d We have become a dangerously self-conscious people, painfully aware of the need to be fulfilled, yet knowing we are not. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, like so many saints, sought to serve others, to do something outside herself, to forget herself in quiet acts of love. She is one of the great examples of the gospel paradox that we gain our life by losing it, and that the seed that falls to the ground must die in order to live.\nPreoccupation with self separates modern men and women from God, from their fellow human beings, and ultimately from themselves. We must re-learn to forget ourselves, to contemplate a God who draws us out of ourselves, and to serve others as the ultimate expression of selfhood. These are the insights of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and they are more valid today than ever.\nSaint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is the Patron Saint of:\nFlorists\nMissionaries\nPilots\nPriests\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Feast of the Guardian Angels\nPerhaps no aspect of Catholic piety is as comforting to parents as the belief that an angel protects their little ones from dangers real and imagined. Yet guardian angels are not only for children. Their role is to represent individuals before God, to watch over them always, to aid their prayer, and to present their souls to God at death.\nThe concept of an angel assigned to guide and nurture each human being is a development of Catholic doctrine and piety based on Scripture but not directly drawn from it. Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 18:10 best support the belief: \u201cSee that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.\u201d\nDevotion to the angels began to develop with the birth of the monastic tradition. Saint\u00a0Benedict gave it impetus and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, the great 12th-century reformer, was such an eloquent spokesman for the guardian angels that angelic devotion assumed its current form in his day.\nA feast in honor of the guardian angels was first observed in the 16th century. In 1615, Pope Paul V added it to the Roman calendar.\nReflection\nDevotion to the angels is, at base, an expression of faith in God\u2019s enduring love and providential care extended to each person day in and day out.\n",

For several years she cared for her mother and younger sister. She entered the Sisters of Providence in 1823, taking the name Sister Saint\u00a0Theodore.

She was to establish a motherhouse and novitiate. Only later did she learn that her French superiors had already decided the sisters in the United States should form a new religious congregation under her leadership.\nMother Theodore and her community persevered despite fires, crop failures, prejudice against Catholic women religious, misunderstandings, and separation from their original religious congregation. She once told her sisters, \u201cHave confidence in the Providence that so far has never failed us. The way is not yet clear. Grope along slowly. Do not press matters; be patient, be trustful.\u201d Another time she asked, \u201cWith Jesus, what shall we have to fear?\u201d\nMother Theodore was buried in the Church of the Immaculate Conception, now the Shrine of St. Mother Theodore, in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana.

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe patron saint of Italy, Francis of Assisi, was a poor little man who astounded and inspired the Church by taking the gospel literally\u2014not in a narrow fundamentalist sense, but by actually following all that Jesus said and did, joyfully, without limit, and without a sense of self-importance.\nSerious illness brought the young Francis to see the emptiness of his frolicking life as leader of Assisi\u2019s youth. Prayer\u2014lengthy and difficult\u2014led him to a self-emptying like that of Christ, climaxed by embracing a leper he met on the road. It symbolized his complete obedience to what he had heard in prayer: \u201cFrancis! Everything you have loved and desired in the flesh it is your duty to despise and hate, if you wish to know my will. And when you have begun this, all that now seems sweet and lovely to you will become intolerable and bitter, but all that you used to avoid will turn itself to great sweetness and exceeding joy.\u201d\nFrom the cross in the neglected field-chapel of San Damiano, Christ told him, \u201cFrancis, go out and build up my house, for it is nearly falling down.\u201d Francis became the totally poor and humble workman.\nHe must have suspected a deeper meaning to \u201cbuild up my house.\u201d But he would have been content to be for the rest of his life the poor \u201cnothing\u201d man actually putting brick on brick in abandoned chapels. He gave up all his possessions, piling even his clothes before his earthly father\u2014who was demanding restitution for Francis\u2019 \u201cgifts\u201d to the poor\u2014so that he would be totally free to say, \u201cOur Father in heaven.\u201d He was, for a time, considered to be a religious fanatic, begging from door to door when he could not get money for his work, evoking sadness or disgust to the hearts of his former friends, ridicule from the unthinking.\nBut genuineness will tell. A few people began to realize that this man was actually trying to be Christian. He really believed what Jesus said: \u201cAnnounce the kingdom! Possess no gold or silver or copper in your purses, no traveling bag, no sandals, no staff\u201d (Luke 9:1-3).\nFrancis\u2019 first rule for his followers was a collection of texts from the Gospels. He had no intention of founding an order, but once it began he protected it and accepted all the legal structures needed to support it. His devotion and loyalty to the Church were absolute and highly exemplary at a time when various movements of reform tended to break the Church\u2019s unity.\nFrancis was torn between a life devoted entirely to prayer and a life of active preaching of the Good News. He decided in favor of the latter, but always returned to solitude when he could. He wanted to be a missionary in Syria or in Africa, but was prevented by shipwreck and illness in both cases. He did try to convert the sultan of Egypt during the Fifth Crusade.\nDuring the last years of his relatively short life, he died at 44, Francis was half blind and seriously ill. Two years before his death he received the stigmata, the real and painful wounds of Christ in his hands, feet and side.\nOn his deathbed, Francis said over and over again the last addition to his Canticle of the Sun, \u201cBe praised, O Lord, for our Sister Death.\u201d He sang Psalm 141, and at the end asked his superior\u2019s permission to have his clothes removed when the last hour came in order that he could expire lying naked on the earth, in imitation of his Lord.\nReflection\nFrancis of Assisi was poor only that he might be Christ-like. He recognized creation as another manifestation of the beauty of God. In 1979, he was named patron of ecology. He did great penance\u2014apologizing to \u201cBrother Body\u201d later in life\u2014that he might be totally disciplined for the will of God. Francis\u2019 poverty had a sister, Humility, by which he meant total dependence on the good God. But all this was, as it were, preliminary to the heart of his spirituality: living the gospel life, summed up in the charity of Jesus and perfectly expressed in the Eucharist.\nSaint Francis of Assisi is the Patron Saint of:\nAnimals\nArchaeologists\nEcology\nItaly\nMerchants\nMessengers\nMetal Workers\n",

She worked as a housekeeper in three cities before joining the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy in 1925. She worked as a cook, gardener and porter in three of their houses.\nIn addition to carrying out her work faithfully, generously serving the needs of the sisters and the local people, Sister Faustina also had a deep interior life. This included receiving revelations from the Lord Jesus, messages that she recorded in her diary at the request of Christ and of her confessors.\n\nAt a time when some Catholics had an image of God as such a strict judge that they might be tempted to despair about the possibility of being forgiven, Jesus chose to emphasize his mercy and forgiveness for sins acknowledged and confessed. \u201cI do not want to punish aching mankind,\u201d he once told Saint\u00a0Faustina, \u201cbut I desire to heal it, pressing it to my merciful heart.\u201d The two rays emanating from Christ\u2019s heart, she said, represent the blood and water poured out after Jesus\u2019 death.\nBecause Sister Maria Faustina knew that the revelations she had already received did not constitute holiness itself, she wrote in her diary: \u201cNeither graces, nor revelations, nor raptures, nor gifts granted to a soul make it perfect, but rather the intimate union of the soul with God. These gifts are merely ornaments of the soul, but constitute neither its essence nor its perfection. My sanctity and perfection consist in the close union of my will with the will of God.\u201d\nSister Maria Faustina died of tuberculosis in Krakow, Poland, on October 5, 1938. Pope John Paul II beatified her in 1993, and canonized her seven years later.\nReflection\nDevotion to God\u2019s Divine Mercy bears some resemblance to devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In both cases, sinners are encouraged not to despair, not to doubt God\u2019s willingness to forgive them if they repent. As Psalm 136 says in each of its 26 verses, \u201cGod\u2019s love [mercy] endures forever.\u201d\n",

No doubt both the founder and the members would reject such high praise, but it is an indication of the saint\u2019s intense love of a penitential life in solitude.\nBruno was born in Cologne, Germany, became a famous teacher at Rheims, and was appointed chancellor of the archdiocese at the age of 45. He supported Pope Gregory VII in his fight against the decadence of the clergy, and took part in the removal of his own scandalous archbishop, Manasses. Bruno suffered the plundering of his house for his pains.\nHe had a dream of living in solitude and prayer, and persuaded a few friends to join him in a hermitage. After a while he felt the place unsuitable and through a friend, was given some land which was to become famous for his foundation \u201cin the Chartreuse\u201d\u2014from which comes the word Carthusians. The climate, desert, mountainous terrain, and inaccessibility guaranteed silence, poverty, and small numbers.\nBruno and his friends built an oratory with small individual cells at a distance from each other. They met for Matins and Vespers each day and spent the rest of the time in solitude, eating together only on great feasts. Their chief work was copying manuscripts.\nHearing of Bruno\u2019s holiness, the pope called for his assistance in Rome. When the pope had to flee Rome, Bruno pulled up stakes again, and after refusing a bishopric, spent his last years in the wilderness of Calabria.\nBruno was never formally canonized, because the Carthusians were averse to all occasions of publicity. However, Pope Clement X extended his feast to the whole Church in 1674.\nReflection\nIf there is always a certain uneasy questioning of the contemplative life, there is an even greater puzzlement about the extremely penitential combination of community and hermit life lived by the Carthusians.

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of Our Lady of the Rosary\nSaint\u00a0Pius V established this feast in 1573. The purpose was to thank God for the victory of Christians over the Turks at Lepanto\u2014a victory attributed to the praying of the rosary. Clement XI extended the feast to the universal Church in 1716.\nThe development of the rosary has a long history. First a practice developed of praying 150 Our Fathers in imitation of the 150 Psalms. Then there was a parallel practice of praying 150 Hail Marys. Soon a mystery of Jesus\u2019 life was attached to each Hail Mary. Though Mary\u2019s giving of the rosary to Saint\u00a0Dominic is recognized as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the followers of Saint\u00a0Dominic. One of them, Alan de la Roche, was known as \u201cthe apostle of the rosary.\u201d He founded the first Confraternity of the Rosary in the 15th century. In the 16th century, the rosary was developed to its present form\u2014with the 15 mysteries: joyful, sorrowful and glorious. In 2002, Pope John Paul II added five Mysteries of Light to this devotion.\n\nReflection\nThe purpose of the rosary is to help us meditate on the great mysteries of our salvation. Pius XII called it a compendium of the gospel. The main focus is on Jesus\u2014his birth, life, death, and resurrection. The Our Fathers remind us that Jesus\u2019 Father is the initiator of salvation. The Hail Marys remind us to join with Mary in contemplating these mysteries. They also make us aware that Mary was and is intimately joined with her Son in all the mysteries of his earthly and heavenly existence. The Glory Bes remind us that the purpose of all life is the glory of the Trinity.\nThe rosary appeals to many. It is simple. The constant repetition of words helps create an atmosphere in which to contemplate the mysteries of God. We sense that Jesus and Mary are with us in the joys and sorrows of life. We grow in hope that God will bring us to share in the glory of Jesus and Mary forever.\n",

He chose to become a priest.\nAfter his ordination, Fr. Leonardi became very active in the works of the ministry, especially in hospitals and prisons. The example and dedication of his work attracted several young laymen who began to assist him. They later became priests themselves.\nJohn lived after the Protestant Reformation and the Council of Trent. He and his followers projected a new congregation of diocesan priests. For some reason the plan, which was ultimately approved, provoked great political opposition. John was exiled from his home town of Lucca, Italy, for almost the entire remainder of his life. He received encouragement and help from Saint\u00a0Philip Neri, who gave him his lodgings\u2014along with the care of his cat!\nIn 1579, John formed the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, and published a compendium of Christian doctrine that remained in use until the 19th century.\nFather Leonardi and his priests became a great power for good in Italy, and their congregation was confirmed by Pope Clement in 1595. John died at the age of 68 from a disease caught when tending those stricken by the plague.\nBy the deliberate policy of the founder, the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God have never had more than 15 churches, and today form only a very small congregation.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast of Saint John Leonardi is October 9.\nReflection\nWhat can one person do?

Indeed, one writer has noted that his \u201cordinariness\u201d seems one of his most remarkable qualities.\nThe firstborn son of a farming family in Sotto il Monte, near Bergamo in northern Italy, Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was always proud of his down-to-earth roots. In Bergamo\u2019s diocesan seminary, he joined the Secular Franciscan Order.\nAfter his ordination in 1904, Fr. Roncalli returned to Rome for canon law studies. He soon worked as his bishop\u2019s secretary, Church history teacher in the seminary, and as publisher of the diocesan paper.\nHis service as a stretcher-bearer for the Italian army during World War I gave him a firsthand knowledge of war. In 1921, Fr. Roncalli was made national director in Italy of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. He also found time to teach patristics at a seminary in the Eternal City.\n\nIn 1925, he became a papal diplomat, serving first in Bulgaria, then in Turkey, and finally in France. During World War II, he became well acquainted with Orthodox Church leaders. With the help of Germany\u2019s ambassador to Turkey, Archbishop Roncalli helped save an estimated 24,000 Jewish people.\nNamed a cardinal and appointed patriarch of Venice in 1953, he was finally a residential bishop. A month short of entering his 78th year, Cardinal Roncalli was elected pope, taking the name John after his father and the two patrons of Rome\u2019s cathedral, St. John Lateran. Pope John took his work very seriously but not himself. His wit soon became proverbial, and he began meeting with political and religious leaders from around the world. In 1962, he was deeply involved in efforts to resolve the Cuban missile crisis.\nHis most famous encyclicals were Mother and Teacher (1961) and Peace on Earth (1963). Pope John XXIII enlarged the membership in the College of Cardinals and made it more international. At his address at the opening of the Second Vatican Council, he criticized the \u201cprophets of doom\u201d who \u201cin these modern times see nothing but prevarication and ruin.\u201d Pope John XXIII set a tone for the Council when he said, \u201cThe Church has always opposed\u2026 errors. Nowadays, however, the Spouse of Christ prefers to make use of the medicine of mercy rather than that of severity.\u201d\nOn his deathbed, Pope John said: \u201cIt is not that the gospel has changed; it is that we have begun to understand it better. Those who have lived as long as I have\u2026were enabled to compare different cultures and traditions, and know that the moment has come to discern the signs of the times, to seize the opportunity and to look far ahead.\u201d\n\u201cGood Pope John\u201d died on June 3, 1963. Saint\u00a0John Paul II beatified him in 2000, and Pope Francis canonized him in 2014.\nReflection\nThroughout his life, Angelo Roncalli cooperated with God\u2019s grace, believing that the job at hand was worthy of his best efforts. His sense of God\u2019s providence made him the ideal person to promote a new dialogue with Protestant and Orthodox Christians, as well as with Jews and Muslims. In the sometimes noisy crypt of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, many people become silent on seeing the simple tomb of Pope John XXIII, grateful for the gift of his life and holiness. After his beatification, his tomb was moved into the basilica itself.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nBlessed Marie-Rose Durocher\u2019s Story\nCanada was one diocese from coast to coast during the first eight years of Marie-Rose Durocher\u2019s life. Its half-million Catholics had received civil and religious liberty from the English only 44 years before.\nShe was born in a little village near Montreal in 1811, the 10th of 11 children. She had a good education, was something of a tomboy, rode a horse named Caesar, and could have married well. At 16, she felt the desire to become a religious, but was forced to abandon the idea because of her weak constitution. At 18, when her mother died, her priest brother invited Marie-Rose and their father to come to his parish in Beloeil, not far from Montreal.\nFor 13 years, Marie-Rose served as housekeeper, hostess, and parish worker. She became well-known for her graciousness, courtesy, leadership, and tact; she was, in fact, called \u201cthe saint of Beloeil.\u201d Perhaps she was too tactful during two years when her brother treated her coldly.\nWhen Marie-Rose was 29, Bishop Ignace Bourget\u2014who would be a decisive influence in her life\u2014became bishop of Montreal. He\u00a0faced a shortage of priests and sisters and a rural population that had been largely deprived of education. Like his counterparts in the United States, Bishop Bourget scoured Europe for help, and himself founded four communities, one of which was the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. Its first sister and reluctant co-foundress was Marie-Rose Durocher.\nAs a young woman, Marie-Rose had hoped there would someday be a community of teaching sisters in every parish, never thinking she would found one. But her spiritual director, Oblate of Mary Immaculate Father Pierre Telmon, after thoroughly\u2014and severely\u2014leading her in the spiritual life, urged her to found a community herself. Bishop Bourget concurred, but Marie-Rose shrank from the prospect. She was in poor health and her father and brother needed her.\nFinally Marie-Rose agreed, and with two friends, Melodie Dufresne and Henriette Cere, entered a little home in Longueuil, across the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal. With them were 13 young girls already assembled for boarding school. Longueuil became her Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Gethsemane. Marie-Rose was 32 and would live only six more years\u2014years filled with poverty, trials, sickness, and slander. The qualities she had nurtured in her \u201chidden\u201d life came forward\u2014a strong will, intelligence and common sense, great inner courage, and yet a great deference to directors. Thus was born an international congregation of women religious dedicated to education in the faith.\nMarie-Rose was severe with herself and by today\u2019s standards quite strict with her sisters. Beneath it all, of course, was an unshakable love of her crucified Savior.\nOn her deathbed, the prayers most frequently on her lips were \u201cJesus, Mary, Joseph! Sweet Jesus, I love you. Jesus, be to me Jesus!\u201d Before she died, Marie-Rose smiled and said to the sister with her, \u201cYour prayers are keeping me here\u2014let me go.\u201d\nMarie-Rose Durocher was beatified in 1982. Her Liturgical\u00a0Feast Day is October 6.\nReflection\nWe have seen a great burst of charity, a genuine interest in the poor. Countless Christians have experienced a deep form of prayer. But penance? We squirm when we read of terrible physical penance done by people like Marie-Rose Durocher. That is not for most people, of course. But the pull of a materialistic culture oriented to pleasure and entertainment is impossible to resist without some form of deliberate and Christ-conscious abstinence. That is part of the way to answer Jesus\u2019 call to repent and turn completely to God.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Callistus I\u2019s Story\nThe most reliable information about this saint comes from his enemy Saint\u00a0Hippolytus, an early antipope, later a martyr for the Church. A negative principle is used: If some worse things had happened, Hippolytus would surely have mentioned them.\nCallistus was a slave in the imperial Roman household. Put in charge of the bank by his master, he lost the money deposited, fled, and was caught. After serving time for a while, he was released to make some attempt to recover the money. Apparently he carried his zeal too far, being arrested for brawling in a Jewish synagogue. This time he was condemned to work in the mines of Sardinia. Through the influence of the emperor\u2019s mistress he was released and went to live at Anzio.\nAfter winning his freedom, Callistus was made superintendent of the public Christian burial ground in Rome\u2014still called the cemetery of Saint\u00a0Callistus\u2014probably the first land owned by the Church. The pope ordained him a deacon and made him his friend and adviser.\nCallistus was elected pope by a majority vote of the clergy and laity of Rome, and thereafter was bitterly attacked by the losing candidate, Saint\u00a0Hippolytus, who let himself be set up as the first antipope in the history of the Church. The schism lasted about 18 years.\nHippolytus is venerated as a saint. He was banished during the persecution of 235 and was reconciled to the Church. He died from his sufferings in Sardinia. He attacked Callistus on two fronts\u2014doctrine and discipline. Hippolytus seems to have exaggerated the distinction between Father and Son\u2014almost making two gods\u2014possibly because theological language had not yet been refined. He also accused Callistus of being too lenient, for reasons we may find surprising: 1) Callistus admitted to Holy Communion those who had already done public penance for murder, adultery, and fornication; 2) he held marriages between free women and slaves to be valid\u2014contrary to Roman law; 3) he authorized the ordination of men who had been married two or three times; 4) he held that mortal sin was not a sufficient reason to depose a bishop; 5) he held to a policy of leniency toward those who had temporarily denied their faith during persecution.\nCallistus was martyred during a local disturbance in Trastevere, Rome, and is the first pope\u2014except for Peter\u2014to be commemorated as a martyr in the earliest martyrology of the Church.\nReflection\nThe life of this man is another reminder that the course of Church history, like that of true love, never did run smooth. The Church had to\u2014and still must\u2014go through the agonizing struggle to state the mysteries of the faith in language that, at the very least, sets up definite barriers to error. On the disciplinary side, the Church had to preserve the mercy of Christ against rigorism, while still upholding the gospel ideal of radical conversion and self-discipline. Every pope\u2014indeed every Christian\u2014must walk the difficult path between \u201creasonable\u201d indulgence and \u201creasonable\u201d rigorism.\n",

It was the 16th century, a time of turmoil and reform. She was born before the Protestant Reformation and died almost 20 years after the closing of the Council of Trent.\nThe gift of God to Teresa in and through which she became holy and left her mark on the Church and the world is threefold: She was a woman; she was a contemplative; she was an active reformer.\nAs a woman, Teresa stood on her own two feet, even in the man\u2019s world of her time. She was \u201cher own woman,\u201d entering the Carmelites despite strong opposition from her father. She is a person wrapped not so much in silence as in mystery. Beautiful, talented, outgoing, adaptable, affectionate, courageous, enthusiastic, she was totally human. Like Jesus, she was a mystery of paradoxes: wise, yet practical; intelligent, yet much in tune with her experience; a mystic, yet an energetic reformer; a holy woman, a womanly woman.\nTeresa was a woman \u201cfor God,\u201d a woman of prayer, discipline, and compassion. Her heart belonged to God. Her ongoing conversion was an arduous lifelong struggle, involving ongoing purification and suffering. She was misunderstood, misjudged, and opposed in her efforts at reform. Yet she struggled on, courageous and faithful; she struggled with her own mediocrity, her illness, her opposition. And in the midst of all this she clung to God in life and in prayer. Her writings on prayer and contemplation are drawn from her experience: powerful, practical, and graceful. She was a woman of prayer; a woman for God.\nTeresa was a woman \u201cfor others.\u201d Though a contemplative, she spent much of her time and energy seeking to reform herself and the Carmelites, to lead them back to the full observance of the primitive Rule. She founded over a half-dozen new monasteries. She traveled, wrote, fought\u2014always to renew, to reform. In her self, in her prayer, in her life, in her efforts to reform, in all the people she touched, she was a woman for others, a woman who inspired and gave life.\nHer writings, especially the Way of Perfection and The Interior Castle, have helped generations of believers.\nIn 1970, the Church gave her the title she had long held in the popular mind: Doctor of the Church. She and St. Catherine of Siena were the first women so honored.\nReflection\nOurs is a time of turmoil, a time of reform, and a time of liberation. Modern women have in Teresa a challenging example. Promoters of renewal, promoters of prayer, all have in Teresa a woman to reckon with, one whom they can admire and imitate.\nSaint Teresa of Avila is the Patron Saint of:\nheadaches\n",

A fellow novice termed Margaret Mary humble, simple, and frank, but above all, kind and patient under sharp criticism and correction. She could not meditate in the formal way expected, though she tried her best to give up her \u201cprayer of simplicity.\u201d Slow, quiet, and clumsy, she was assigned to help an infirmarian who was a bundle of energy.\nOn December 21, 1674, three years a nun, she received the first of her revelations. She felt \u201cinvested\u201d with the presence of God, though always afraid of deceiving herself in such matters. The request of Christ was that his love for humankind be made evident through her.\nDuring the next 13 months, Christ appeared to her at intervals. His human heart was to be the symbol of his divine-human love. By her own love Margaret Mary was to make up for the coldness and ingratitude of the world\u2014by frequent and loving Holy Communion, especially on the first Friday of each month, and by an hour\u2019s vigil of prayer every Thursday night in memory of his agony and isolation in Gethsemane. He also asked that a feast of reparation be instituted.\nLike all saints, Margaret Mary had to pay for her gift of holiness. Some of her own sisters were hostile. Theologians who were called in declared her visions delusions and suggested that she eat more heartily. Later, parents of children she taught called her an impostor, an unorthodox innovator. A new confessor, the Jesuit Claude de la Colombi\u00e8re, recognized her genuineness and supported her. Against her great resistance, Christ called her to be a sacrificial victim for the shortcomings of her own sisters, and to make this known.\nAfter serving as novice mistress and assistant superior, Margaret Mary died at the age of 43, while being anointed. She said: \u201cI need nothing but God, and to lose myself in the heart of Jesus.\u201d\nReflection\nOur scientific-materialistic age cannot \u201cprove\u201d private revelations. Theologians, if pressed, admit that we do not have to believe in them. But it is impossible to deny the message Margaret Mary heralded: that God loves us with a passionate love. Her insistence on reparation and prayer and the reminder of final judgment should be sufficient to ward off superstition and superficiality in devotion to the Sacred Heart while preserving its deep Christian meaning.\nOther Saints of the Day for October 16 are Saint Gerard Majella and Saint Hedwig.\n\n",

Ignatius would not deny Christ and thus was condemned to be put to death in Rome.\nIgnatius is well known for the seven letters he wrote on the long journey from Antioch to Rome. Five of these letters are to churches in Asia Minor; they urge the Christians there to remain faithful to God and to obey their superiors. He warns them against heretical doctrines, providing them with the solid truths of the Christian faith.\nThe sixth letter was to Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who was later martyred for the faith. The final letter begs the Christians in Rome not to try to stop his martyrdom. \u201cThe only thing I ask of you is to allow me to offer the libation of my blood to God. I am the wheat of the Lord; may I be ground by the teeth of the beasts to become the immaculate bread of Christ.\u201d\nIgnatius bravely met the lions in the Circus Maximus.\nReflection\nIgnatius\u2019s great concern was for the unity and order of the Church. Even greater was his willingness to suffer martyrdom rather than deny his Lord Jesus Christ. He did not draw attention to his own suffering, but to the love of God which strengthened him.

As a young Jesuit, Isaac Jogues, a man of learning and culture, taught literature in France. He gave up that career to work among the Huron Indians in the New World, and in 1636, he and his companions, under the leadership of Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, arrived in Quebec. The Hurons were constantly warred upon by the Iroquois, and in a few years Father Jogues was captured by the Iroquois and imprisoned for 13 months. His letters and journals tell how he and his companions were led from village to village, how they were beaten, tortured, and forced to watch as their Huron converts were mangled and killed.\nAn unexpected chance for escape came to Isaac Jogues through the Dutch, and he returned to France, bearing the marks of his sufferings. Several fingers had been cut, chewed, or burnt off. Pope Urban VIII gave him permission to offer Mass with his mutilated hands: \u201cIt would be shameful that a martyr of Christ not be allowed to drink the Blood of Christ.\u201d\nWelcomed home as a hero, Father Jogues might have sat back, thanked God for his safe return, and died peacefully in his homeland. But his zeal led him back once more to the fulfillment of his dreams. In a few months he sailed for his missions among the Hurons.\nIn 1646, he and Jean de Lalande, who had offered his services to the missioners, set out for Iroquois country in the belief that a recently signed peace treaty would be observed. They were captured by a Mohawk war party, and on October 18, Father Jogues was tomahawked and beheaded. Jean de Lalande was killed the next day at Ossernenon, a village near Albany, New York.\nThe first of the Jesuit missionaries to be martyred was Ren\u00e9 Goupil who with Lalande, had offered his services as an oblate. He was tortured along with Isaac Jogues in 1642, and was tomahawked for having made the sign of the cross on the brow of some children.\nFather Anthony Daniel, working among Hurons who were gradually becoming Christian, was killed by Iroquois on July 4, 1648. His body was thrown into his chapel, which was set on fire.\nJean de Br\u00e9beuf was a French Jesuit who came to Canada at the age of 32 and labored there for 24 years. He went back to France when the English captured Quebec in 1629 and expelled the Jesuits, but returned to his missions four years later. Although medicine men blamed the Jesuits for a smallpox epidemic among the Hurons, Jean remained with them.\nHe composed catechisms and a dictionary in Huron, and saw 7,000 converted before his death in 1649. Having been captured by the Iroquois at Sainte Marie, near Georgian Bay, Canada, Father Br\u00e9beuf died after four hours of extreme torture.\nGabriel Lalemant had taken a fourth vow\u2014to sacrifice his life for the Native Americans. He was horribly tortured to death along with Father Br\u00e9beuf.\nFather Charles Garnier was shot to death in 1649 as he baptized children and catechumens during an Iroquois attack.\nFather Noel Chabanel also was killed in 1649, before he could answer his recall to France. He had found it exceedingly hard to adapt to mission life. He could not learn the language, and the food and life of the Indians revolted him, plus he suffered spiritual dryness during his whole stay in Canada. Yet he made a vow to remain in his mission until death.\nThese eight Jesuit martyrs of North America were canonized in 1930.\nReflection\nFaith and heroism planted belief in Christ\u2019s cross deep in our land. The Church in North America sprang from the blood of martyrs, as has been true in so many places. The ministry and sacrifices of these saints challenges each of us, causing us to ask just how deep is our faith and how strong our desire to serve even in the face of death.\nSaints Isaac Jogues, Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, and Companions are the Patron Saints of:\nNorth America\nNorway\n",

People were naturally drawn to Hilarion as a source of spiritual wisdom and peace. He had reached such fame by the time of his death that his body had to be secretly removed so that a shrine would not be built in his honor. Instead, he was buried in his home village.\nSaint\u00a0Hilarion the Great, as he is sometimes called, was born in Palestine. After his conversion to Christianity, he spent some time with Saint\u00a0Anthony of Egypt, another holy man drawn to solitude. Hilarion lived a life of hardship and simplicity in the desert, where he also experienced spiritual dryness that included temptations to despair. At the same time, miracles were attributed to him.\nAs his fame grew, a small group of disciples wanted to follow Hilarion. He began a series of journeys to find a place where he could live away from the world. He finally settled on Cyprus, where he died in 371 at about age 80.\nHilarion is celebrated as the founder of monasticism in Palestine. Much of his fame flows from the biography of him written by Saint\u00a0Jerome.\nReflection\nWe can learn the value of solitude from Saint\u00a0Hilarion. Unlike loneliness, solitude is a positive condition in which we are alone with God. In today\u2019s busy and noisy world, we could all use a little solitude.",

Karol\u2019s promising academic career at Krakow\u2019s Jagiellonian University was cut short by the outbreak of World War II. While working in a quarry and a chemical factory, he enrolled in an \u201cunderground\u201d seminary in Krak\u00f3w. Ordained in 1946, he was immediately sent to Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology.\nBack in Poland, a short assignment as assistant pastor in a rural parish preceded his very fruitful chaplaincy for university students. Soon Fr. Wojtyla earned a doctorate in philosophy and began teaching that subject at Poland\u2019s University of Lublin.\nCommunist officials allowed Wojtyla to be appointed auxiliary bishop of Krak\u00f3w in 1958, considering him a relatively harmless intellectual. They could not have been more wrong!\nBishop Wojtyla attended all four sessions of Vatican II and contributed especially to its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World. Appointed as archbishop of Krak\u00f3w in 1964, he was named a cardinal three years later.\n\nElected pope in October 1978, he took the name of his short-lived, immediate predecessor. Pope John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. In time, he made pastoral visits to 124 countries, including several with small Christian populations.\nJohn Paul II promoted ecumenical and interfaith initiatives, especially the 1986 Day of Prayer for World Peace in Assisi. He visited Rome\u2019s main synagogue and the Western Wall in Jerusalem; he also established diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Israel. He improved Catholic-Muslim relations, and in 2001 visited a mosque in Damascus, Syria.\nThe Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, a key event in John Paul\u2019s ministry, was marked by special celebrations in Rome and elsewhere for Catholics and other Christians. Relations with the Orthodox Churches improved considerably during his papacy.\n\u201cChrist is the center of the universe and of human history\u201d was the opening line of John Paul II\u2019s 1979 encyclical, Redeemer of the Human Race. In 1995, he described himself to the United Nations General Assembly as \u201ca witness to hope.\u201d\nHis 1979 visit to Poland encouraged the growth of the Solidarity movement there and the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe 10 years later. John Paul II began World Youth Day and traveled to several countries for those celebrations. He very much wanted to visit China and the Soviet Union, but the governments in those countries prevented that.\nOne of the most well-remembered photos of John Paul II\u2019s pontificate was his one-on-one conversation in 1983, with Mehmet Ali Agca, who had attempted to assassinate him two years earlier.\nIn his 27 years of papal ministry, John Paul II wrote 14 encyclicals and five books, canonized 482 saints and beatified 1,338 people.\u00a0In the last years of his life, he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and was forced to cut back on some of his activities.\nPope Benedict XVI beatified John Paul II in 2011, and Pope Francis canonized him in 2014.\nReflection\nBefore John Paul II\u2019s funeral Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square, hundreds of thousands of people had waited patiently for a brief moment to pray before his body, which lay in state inside St. Peter\u2019s for several days. The media coverage of his funeral was unprecedented.\nPresiding at the funeral Mass, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger\u2014then dean of the College of Cardinals and later Pope Benedict XVI\u2014concluded his homily by saying: \u201cNone of us can ever forget how, in that last Easter Sunday of his life, the Holy Father, marked by suffering, came once more to the window of the Apostolic Palace and one last time gave his blessing urbi et orbi (\u2018to the city and to the world\u2019).\n\u201cWe can be sure that our beloved pope is standing today at the window of the Father\u2019s house, that sees us and blesses us. Yes, bless us, Holy Father. We entrust your dear soul to the Mother of God, your Mother, who guided you each day and who will guide you now to the glory of her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint John of Capistrano\u2019s Story\nIt has been said the Christian saints are the world\u2019s greatest optimists. Not blind to the existence and consequences of evil, they base their confidence on the power of Christ\u2019s redemption. The power of conversion through Christ extends not only to sinful people but also to calamitous events.\nImagine being born in the 14th century. One-third of the population and nearly 40 percent of the clergy were wiped out by the bubonic plague. The Western Schism split the Church with two or three claimants to the Holy See at one time. England and France were at war. The city-states of Italy were constantly in conflict. No wonder that gloom dominated the spirit of the culture and the times.\nJohn Capistrano was born in 1386. His education was thorough. His talents and success were great. When he was 26 he was made governor of Perugia. Imprisoned after a battle against the Malatestas, he resolved to change his way of life completely. At the age of 30 he entered the Franciscan novitiate and was ordained a priest four years later.\nJohn\u2019s preaching attracted great throngs at a time of religious apathy and confusion. He and 12 Franciscan brethren were received in the countries of central Europe as angels of God. They were instrumental in reviving a dying faith and devotion.\nThe Franciscan Order itself was in turmoil over the interpretation and observance of the Rule of St. Francis. Through John\u2019s tireless efforts and his expertise in law, the heretical Fraticelli were suppressed and the \u201cSpirituals\u201d were freed from interference in their stricter observance.\nJohn of Capistrano helped bring about a brief reunion with the Greek and Armenian Churches.\nWhen the Turks captured Constantinople in 1453, John was commissioned to preach a crusade for the defense of Europe. Gaining little response in Bavaria and Austria, he decided to concentrate his efforts in Hungary. He led the army to Belgrade. Under the great General John Hunyadi, they gained an overwhelming victory, and the siege of Belgrade was lifted. Worn out by his superhuman efforts, Capistrano was an easy prey to an infection after the battle. He died on October 23, 1456.\nReflection\nJohn Hofer, a biographer of John Capistrano, recalls a Brussels organization named after the saint. Seeking to solve life problems in a fully Christian spirit, its motto was: \u201cInitiative, Organization, Activity.\u201d These three words characterized John\u2019s life. He was not one to sit around. His deep Christian optimism drove him to battle problems at all levels with the confidence engendered by a deep faith in Christ.\nSaint John of Capistrano is Patron Saint of:\nJudges\n",

He was a Spaniard whose work took him to the Canary Islands, Cuba, Madrid, Paris, and to the First Vatican Council.\nIn his spare time as weaver and designer in the textile mills of Barcelona, Anthony learned Latin and printing: The future priest and publisher was preparing. Ordained at 28, he was prevented by ill health from entering religious life as a Carthusian or as a Jesuit, but went on to become one of Spain\u2019s most popular preachers.\nAnthony spent 10 years giving popular missions and retreats, always placing great emphasis on the Eucharist and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. It was said that his rosary was never out of his hand. At age 42, he founded a religious institute of missionaries beginning with five young priests, known today as the Claretians.\nAnthony was appointed to head the much-neglected archdiocese of Santiago in Cuba. He began its reform by almost ceaseless preaching and hearing of confessions, and suffered bitter opposition mainly for opposing concubinage and giving instruction to black slaves. A hired assassin\u2014whose release from prison Anthony had obtained\u2014slashed open his face and wrist. Anthony succeeded in getting the would-be assassin\u2019s death sentence commuted to a prison term. His solution for the misery of Cubans was family-owned farms producing a variety of foods for the family\u2019s own needs and for the market. This invited the enmity of the vested interests who wanted everyone to work on a single cash crop\u2014sugar. Besides all his religious writings are two books he wrote in Cuba: Reflections on Agriculture and Country Delights.\nHe was recalled to Spain for a job he did not relish\u2014being chaplain for the queen. Anthony went on three conditions: He would reside away from the palace; he would come only to hear the queen\u2019s confession and instruct the children; and he would be exempt from court functions. In the revolution of 1868, he fled to Paris with the queen\u2019s party, where he preached to the Spanish colony.\nAll his life Anthony was interested in the Catholic press. He founded the Religious Publishing House, a major Catholic publishing venture in Spain, and wrote or published 200 books and pamphlets.\nAt Vatican I, where he was a staunch defender of the doctrine of infallibility, Anthony won the admiration of his fellow bishops. Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore remarked of him, \u201cThere goes a true saint.\u201d At the age of 63, he died in exile near the border of Spain.\nReflection\nJesus foretold that those who are truly his representatives would suffer the same persecution as he did. Besides 14 attempts on his life, Anthony had to undergo such a barrage of the ugliest slander that the very name Claret became a byword for humiliation and misfortune. The powers of evil do not easily give up their prey. No one needs to go looking for persecution. All we need to do is be sure we suffer because of our genuine faith in Christ, not for our own whims and lack of prudence.\nSaint\u00a0Anthony Mary Claret is Patron Saint of:\nWeavers\n",

He served as confessor to Saint\u00a0Teresa of Avila. Church reform was a major issue in Peter\u2019s day, and he directed most of his energies toward that end. His death came one year before the Council of Trent ended.\nBorn into a noble family\u2014his father was the governor of Alcantara in Spain\u2014Peter studied law at Salamanca University, and at 16 he joined the so-called Observant Franciscans, also known as the discalced friars. While he practiced many penances, he also demonstrated abilities which were soon recognized. He was named the superior of a new house even before his ordination as a priest, was elected provincial at the age of 39, and he was a very successful preacher. Still, he was not above washing dishes and cutting wood for the friars. He did not seek attention; indeed, he preferred solitude.\nPeter\u2019s penitential side was evident when it came to food and clothing. It is said that he slept only 90 minutes each night. While others talked about Church reform, Peter\u2019s reform began with himself. His patience was so great that a proverb arose: \u201cTo bear such an insult one must have the patience of Peter of Alcantara.\u201d\nIn 1554, Peter received permission to form a group of Franciscans who followed the Rule of St. Francis with even greater rigor. These friars were known as Alcantarines. Some of the Spanish friars who came to North and South America in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries were members of this group. At the end of the 19th century, the Alcantarines were joined with other Observant friars to form the Order of Friars Minor.\nAs spiritual director to Saint\u00a0Teresa, Peter encouraged her in promoting the Carmelite reform. His preaching brought many people to religious life, especially to the Secular Franciscan Order, the friars, and the Poor Clares.\nPeter of Alcantara was canonized in 1669. His\u00a0Liturgical Feast Day is September 22.\nReflection\nPoverty was a means and not an end for Peter. The goal was following Christ in ever greater purity of heart. Whatever obstructed that path could be eliminated with no real loss. The philosophy of our consumer age\u2014you are worth what you own\u2014may find Peter of Alcantara\u2019s approach severe.

He is not mentioned elsewhere in the Gospels, except of course where all the apostles are mentioned. Scholars hold that he is not the author of the Letter of Jude. Actually, Jude had the same name as Judas Iscariot. Evidently because of the disgrace of that name, it was shortened to \u201cJude\u201d in English.\nSimon is mentioned on all four lists of the apostles. On two of them he is called \u201cthe Zealot.\u201d The Zealots were a Jewish sect that represented an extreme of Jewish nationalism. For them, the messianic promise of the Old Testament meant that the Jews were to be a free and independent nation. God alone was their king, and any payment of taxes to the Romans\u2014the very domination of the Romans\u2014was a blasphemy against God. No doubt some of the Zealots were the spiritual heirs of the Maccabees, carrying on their ideals of religion and independence. But many were the counterparts of modern terrorists. They raided and killed, attacking both foreigners and \u201ccollaborating\u201d Jews. They were chiefly responsible for the rebellion against Rome which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.\nReflection\nAs in the case of all the apostles except for Peter, James and John, we are faced with men who are really unknown, and we are struck by the fact that their holiness is simply taken to be a gift of Christ. He chose some unlikely people: a former Zealot, a former (crooked) tax collector, an impetuous fisherman, two \u201csons of thunder,\u201d and a man named Judas Iscariot.\nIt is a reminder that we cannot receive too often. Holiness does not depend on human merit, culture, personality, effort, or achievement. It is entirely God\u2019s creation and gift. God needs no Zealots to bring about the kingdom by force. Jude, like all the saints, is the saint of the impossible: Only God can create his divine life in human beings.

His disappearance was so sudden and convincing that many people assumed he had actually died.\nSeveral successors were appointed during his years in isolation.

There he encountered Henry, a young noble who went on to become Archbishop of Trier. Meanwhile, Wolfgang remained in close contact with the archbishop, teaching in his cathedral school and supporting his efforts to reform the clergy.\nAt the death of the archbishop, Wolfgang chose to become a Benedictine monk and moved to an abbey in Einsiedeln, now part of Switzerland. Ordained a priest, he was appointed director of the monastery school there. Later he was sent to Hungary as a missionary, though his zeal and good will yielded limited results.\nEmperor Otto II appointed him Bishop of Regensburg, near Munich. Wolfgang immediately initiated reform of the clergy and of religious life, preaching with vigor and effectiveness and always demonstrating special concern for the poor. He wore the habit of a monk and lived an austere life.\nThe draw to monastic life never left him, including the desire for a life of solitude. At one point he left his diocese so that he could devote himself to prayer, but his responsibilities as bishop called him back.\u00a0In 994, Wolfgang became ill while on a journey; he died in Puppingen near Linz, Austria. He was canonized in 1052. His feast day is celebrated widely in much of central Europe.\nReflection\nWolfgang could be depicted as a man with rolled-up sleeves. He even tried retiring to solitary prayer, but taking his responsibilities seriously led him back into the service of his diocese. Doing what had to be done was his path to holiness\u2014and ours.\nAnother Saint of the Day for October 31 is Blessed Thomas of Florence.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of Saint Joseph the Worker\nTo foster deep devotion to Saint Joseph among\u00a0Catholics, and in response to the \u201cMay Day\u201d celebrations for workers sponsored by Communists, Pope Pius XII instituted the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker in 1955. This feast extends the long relationship between Joseph and the cause of workers in both Catholic faith and devotion. Beginning in the Book of Genesis, the dignity of human work has long been celebrated as a participation in the creative work of God. By work, humankind both fulfills the command found in Genesis to care for the earth (Gn 2:15) and to be productive in their labors. Saint Joseph, the carpenter and foster father of Jesus, is but one example of the holiness of human labor.\nJesus, too, was a carpenter. He learned the trade from Saint Joseph and spent his early adult years working side-by-side in Joseph\u2019s carpentry\u00a0shop before leaving to pursue his ministry as preacher and healer. In his encyclical Laborem Exercens, Pope John Paul II stated: \u201cthe Church considers it her task always to call attention to the dignity and rights of those who work, to condemn situations in which that dignity and those rights are violated, and to help to guide [social] changes so as to ensure authentic progress by man and society.\u201d\nSaint Joseph is held up as a model of such work. Pius XII emphasized this when he said, \u201cThe spirit flows to you and to all men from the heart of the God-man, Savior of the world, but certainly, no worker was ever more completely and profoundly penetrated by it than the foster father of Jesus, who lived with Him in closest intimacy and community of family life and work.\u201d\nReflection\nTo capture the devotion to Saint Joseph within the Catholic liturgy, in 1870, Pope Pius IX declared Saint Joseph the patron of the universal Church. In 1955, Pope Pius XII added the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker. This silent saint, who was given the noble task of caring and watching over the Virgin Mary and Jesus, now cares for and watches over the Church and models for all the dignity of human work.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Athanasius\u2019 Story\nAthanasius led a tumultuous but dedicated life of service to the Church. He was the great champion of the faith against the widespread heresy of Arianism, the teaching by Arius that Jesus was not truly divine. The vigor of his writings earned him the title of doctor of the Church.\nBorn of a Christian family in Alexandria, Egypt, and given a classical education, Athanasius became secretary to Alexander, the bishop of Alexandria, entered the priesthood and was eventually named bishop himself. His predecessor, Alexander, had been an outspoken critic of a new movement growing in the East\u2014Arianism.\nWhen Athanasius assumed his role as bishop of Alexandria, he continued the fight against Arianism. At first, it seemed that the battle would be easily won and that Arianism would be condemned. Such, however, did not prove to be the case. The Council of Tyre was called and for several reasons that are still unclear, the Emperor Constantine exiled Athanasius to northern Gaul. This was to be the first in a series of travels and exiles reminiscent of the life of Saint Paul.\nAfter Constantine died, his son restored Athanasius as bishop. This lasted only a year, however, for he was deposed once again by a coalition of Arian bishops. Athanasius took his case to Rome, and Pope Julius I called a synod to review the case and other related matters.\nFive times Athanasius was exiled for his defense of the doctrine of Christ\u2019s divinity. During one period of his life, he enjoyed 10 years of relative peace\u2014reading, writing, and promoting the Christian life along the lines of the monastic ideal to which he was greatly devoted. His dogmatic and historical writings are almost all polemic, directed against every aspect of Arianism.\nAmong his ascetical writings, his Life of St. Anthony achieved astonishing popularity and contributed greatly to the establishment of monastic life throughout the Western Christian world.\nReflection\nAthanasius suffered many trials while he was bishop of Alexandria. He was given the grace to remain strong against what probably seemed at times to be insurmountable opposition. Athanasius lived his office as bishop completely. He defended the true faith for his flock, regardless of the cost to himself. In today\u2019s world we are experiencing this same call to remain true to our faith, no matter what.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaints Philip and James\u2019 Story\nJames, Son of Alphaeus: We know nothing of this man except his name, and, of course, the fact that Jesus chose him to be one of the 12 pillars of the New Israel, his Church. He is not the James of Acts, son of Clopas, \u201cbrother\u201d of Jesus and later bishop of Jerusalem and the traditional author of the Letter of James. James, son of Alphaeus, is also known as James the Lesser to avoid confusing him with James the son of Zebedee, also an apostle and known as James the Greater.\nPhilip: Philip came from the same town as Peter and Andrew, Bethsaida in Galilee. Jesus called him directly, whereupon he sought out Nathanael and told him of the \u201cone about whom Moses wrote\u201d (Jn 1:45).\nLike the other apostles, Philip took a long time coming to realize who Jesus was. On one occasion, when Jesus saw the great multitude following him and wanted to give them food, he asked Philip where they should buy bread for the people to eat. Saint John comments, \u201c[Jesus] said this to test him, because he himself knew what he was going to do\u201d (Jn 6:6). Philip answered, \u201cTwo hundred days\u2019 wages worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little [bit]\u201d (Jn 6:7).\nJohn\u2019s story is not a put-down of Philip. It was simply necessary for these men who were to be the foundation stones of the Church to see the clear distinction between humanity\u2019s total helplessness apart from God and the human ability to be a bearer of divine power by God\u2019s gift.\nOn another occasion, we can almost hear the exasperation in Jesus\u2019s voice. After Thomas had complained that they did not know where Jesus was going, Jesus said, \u201cI am the way. If you know me, then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him\u201d (Jn 14:6a, 7). Then Philip said, \u201cMaster, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us\u201d (Jn 14:8). Enough! Jesus answered, \u201cHave I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father\u201d (Jn 14:9a).\nPossibly because Philip bore a Greek name or because he was thought to be close to Jesus, some gentile proselytes came to him and asked him to introduce them to Jesus. Philip went to Andrew, and Andrew went to Jesus. Jesus\u2019s reply in John\u2019s Gospel is indirect; Jesus says that now his \u201chour\u201d has come, that in a short time he will give his life for Jew and gentile alike.\nReflection\nAs in the case of the other apostles, we see in James and Philip human men who became foundation stones of the Church, and we are reminded again that holiness and its consequent apostolate are entirely the gift of God, not a matter of human achieving. All power is God\u2019s power, even the power of human freedom to accept his gifts. \u201cYou will be clothed with power from on high,\u201d Jesus told Philip and the others. Their first commission had been to expel unclean spirits, heal diseases, announce the kingdom. They learned, gradually, that these externals were sacraments of an even greater miracle inside their persons\u2014the divine power to love like God.\nSaints Philip and James are the Patron Saints of:\nUruguay\n\n",

He continued to follow in the footsteps of Honoratus as bishop. Hilary was only 29 when he was chosen bishop of Arles.\nThe new, youthful bishop undertook the role with confidence. He did manual labor to earn money for the poor. He sold sacred vessels to ransom captives. He became a magnificent orator. He traveled everywhere on foot, always wearing simple clothing.\nThat was the bright side. Hilary encountered difficulty in his relationships with other bishops over whom he had some jurisdiction. He unilaterally deposed one bishop. He selected another bishop to replace one who was very ill\u2013but, to complicate matters, did not die!

Meanwhile, Rose invited the women of the neighborhood to recite the rosary in her home, forming a sort of sodality with them.\nAs she looked to her future under the spiritual guidance of a Jesuit priest, Rose became convinced that she was called to become a teacher in the world rather than a contemplative nun in a convent. Clearly, she made the right choice: She was a born teacher, and the free school for girls she opened in 1685 was well received.\nSoon the cardinal invited her to oversee the training of teachers and the administration of schools in his diocese of Montefiascone. As Rose\u2019s reputation grew, she was called upon to organize schools in many parts of Italy, including Rome. Her disposition was right for the task as well, for Rose often met considerable opposition but was never deterred.\nShe died in Rome in 1728, where a number of miracles were attributed to her. She was beatified in 1952 and canonized in 2006. The sodality, or group of women she had invited to prayer, was ultimately given the rank of a religious congregation. Today, the so-called Venerini Sisters can be found in the United States and elsewhere, working among Italian immigrants.\nReflection\nWhatever state of life God calls us to, we bring with us an assortment of experiences, interests and gifts\u2014however small they seem to us.

They knew that human compassion could soften the ravages of this disease.\nForced to quit school at age 13 to work on the family farm, Joseph entered the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary six years later, taking the name of a fourth-century physician and martyr. When his brother Pamphile, a priest in the same congregation, fell ill and was unable to go to the Hawaiian Islands as assigned, Damien quickly volunteered in his place.

Mary asked the children to pray the rosary for world peace, for the end of World War I, for sinners, and for the conversion of Russia.\nMary gave the children three secrets. Following the deaths of Francisco and Jacinta in 1919 and 1920 respectively, Lucia revealed the first secret in 1927. It concerned devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The second secret was a vision of hell. When Lucia grew up she became a Carmelite nun and died in 2005 at the age of 97.\nPope John Paul II directed the Holy See\u2019s Secretary of State to reveal the third secret in 2000; it spoke of a \u201cbishop in white\u201d who was shot by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows into him. Many people linked this vision to the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II in St. Peter\u2019s Square on May 13, 1981.\nThe feast of Our Lady of Fatima was approved by the local bishop in 1930; it was added to the Church\u2019s worldwide calendar in 2002.\nReflection\nThe message of Fatima is simple: Pray. Unfortunately, some people\u2014not Sister Lucia\u2014have distorted these revelations, making them into an apocalyptic event for which they are now the only reliable interpreters. They have, for example, claimed that Mary\u2019s request that the world be consecrated to her has been ignored. Sister Lucia agreed that Pope John Paul II\u2019s public consecration in St. Peter\u2019s Square on March 25, 1984, fulfilled Mary\u2019s request. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith prepared a June 26, 2000, document explaining the \u201cthird secret.\u201d\nMary is perfectly honored when people generously imitate her response \u201cLet it be done to me as you say\u201d (Luke 1:38). Mary can never be seen as a rival to Jesus or to the Church\u2019s teaching authority, as exercised by the college of bishops united with the bishop of Rome.\n",

Now that Judas had betrayed his ministry, it was necessary, Peter said, to fulfill the scriptural recommendation that another should take his office. \u201cTherefore, it is necessary that one of the men who accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus came and went among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us, become with us a witness to his resurrection\u201d (Acts 1:21-22).\nThey nominated two men: Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias. They prayed and drew lots. The choice fell upon Matthias, who was added to the Eleven.\nMatthias is not mentioned by name anywhere else in the New Testament.\nReflection\nWhat was the holiness of Matthias? Obviously, he was suited for apostleship by the experience of being with Jesus from his baptism to his ascension. He must also have been suited personally, or he would not have been nominated for so great a responsibility. Must we not remind ourselves that the fundamental holiness of Matthias was his receiving gladly the relationship with the Father offered him by Jesus and completed by the Holy Spirit? If the apostles are the foundations of our faith by their witness, they must also be reminders, if only implicitly, that holiness is entirely a matter of God\u2019s giving, and it is offered to all, in the everyday circumstances of life.

He married a young woman as simple and upright as himself who also became a saint\u2014Maria de la Cabeza. They had one son, who died as a child.\nIsidore had deep religious instincts. He rose early in the morning to go to church and spent many a holiday devoutly visiting the churches of Madrid and surrounding areas. All day long, as he walked behind the plow, he communed with God. His devotion, one might say, became a problem, for his fellow workers sometimes complained that he often showed up late because of lingering in church too long.\nHe was known for his love of the poor, and there are accounts of Isidore\u2019s supplying them miraculously with food. He had a great concern for the proper treatment of animals.\nHe died May 15, 1130, and was declared a saint in 1622, with Saints Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Teresa of Avila, and Philip Neri.

Her mother died when Margaret was seven; life with her stepmother was so difficult that Margaret moved out. For nine years she lived with Arsenio, though they were not married, and she bore him a son. In those years, she had doubts about her situation. Somewhat like Saint Augustine, she prayed for purity\u2014but not just yet.\nOne day she was waiting for Arsenio and was instead met by his dog. The animal led Margaret into the forest where she found Arsenio murdered. This crime shocked Margaret into a life of penance. She and her son returned to Laviano, where she was not well received by her stepmother. They then went to Cortona, where her son eventually became a friar.\nIn 1277, three years after her conversion, Margaret became a Franciscan tertiary. Under the direction of her confessor, who sometimes had to order her to moderate her self-denial, she pursued a life of prayer and penance at Cortona. There she established a hospital and founded a congregation of tertiary sisters. The poor and humble Margaret was, like Francis, devoted to the Eucharist and to the passion of Jesus. These devotions fueled her great charity and drew sinners to her for advice and inspiration. She was canonized in 1728.\nReflection\nSeeking forgiveness is sometimes difficult work.

The 16th century has been called the Golden Age of the Church in Spain, for it gave birth to Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Peter of Alcantara, Francis Solano, and Salvator of Horta.\nPaschal\u2019s Spanish parents were poor and pious. Between the ages of seven and 24 he worked as a shepherd and began a life of mortification. He was able to pray on the job and was especially attentive to the church bell, which rang at the Elevation during Mass. Paschal had a very honest streak in him. He once offered to pay owners of crops for any damage his animals caused!\nIn 1564, Paschal joined the Friars Minor and gave himself wholeheartedly to a life of penance. Though he was urged to study for the priesthood, he chose to be a brother. At various times he served as porter, cook, gardener, and official beggar.\nPaschal was careful to observe the vow of poverty. He would never waste any food or anything given for the use of the friars. When he was porter and took care of the poor coming to the door, he developed a reputation for great generosity. The friars sometimes tried to moderate his liberality!\nPaschal spent his spare moments praying before the Blessed Sacrament. In time, many people sought his wise counsel. People flocked to his tomb immediately after his burial; miracles were reported promptly. Paschal was canonized in 1690 and was named patron of eucharistic congresses and societies in 1897.\nReflection\nPrayer before the Blessed Sacrament occupied much of Saint Francis\u2019 energy. Most of his letters were to promote devotion to the Eucharist. Paschal shared that concern. An hour in prayer before our Lord in the Eucharist could teach all of us a great deal. Some holy and busy Catholics today find that their work is enriched by those minutes regularly spent in prayer and meditation.\nSaint Paschal Baylon is the Patron Saint of:\nEucharistic Congresses and Societies\nShepherds\n\u00a0",

As a young man, he entered the Franciscans and soon showed his love for solitude and prayer. After admirably completing his studies, he was ordained and assigned to a retreat house near Subiaco. Inspired by the austere life of the Franciscans there, he founded other such houses in Corsica and Tuscany. Over the years, he became famous for his preaching as well as his missionary efforts.\nThough he was always somewhat sickly, Theophilus generously served the needs of God\u2019s people in the confessional, in the sickroom, and at the graveside. Worn out by his labors, he died on June 17, 1740. He was canonized in 1930.\nReflection\nThere is a certain dynamism in all the saints that prompts them to find ever more selfless ways of responding to God\u2019s grace. As time went on, Theophilus gave more and more single-hearted service to God and to God\u2019s sons and daughters.

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Bernardine of Siena\u2019s Story\nMost of the saints suffer great personal opposition, even persecution. Bernardine, by contrast, seems more like a human dynamo who simply took on the needs of the world.\nHe was the greatest preacher of his time, journeying across Italy, calming strife-torn cities, attacking the paganism he found rampant, attracting crowds of 30,000, following Saint Francis of Assisi\u2019s admonition to preach about \u201cvice and virtue, punishment and glory.\u201d\nCompared with Saint Paul by the pope, Bernardine had a keen intuition of the needs of the time, along with solid holiness and boundless energy and joy. He accomplished all this despite having a very weak and hoarse voice, miraculously improved later because of his devotion to Mary.\nWhen he was 20, the plague was at its height in his hometown of Siena. Sometimes as many as 20 people died in one day at the hospital. Bernardine offered to run the hospital and, with the help of other young men, nursed patients there for four months. He escaped the plague, but was so exhausted that a fever confined him for several months. He spent another year caring for a beloved aunt whose parents had died when he was a child, and at her death began to fast and pray to know God\u2019s will for him.\nAt 22, he entered the Franciscan Order and was ordained two years later. For almost a dozen years he lived in solitude and prayer, but his gifts ultimately caused him to be sent to preach. He always traveled on foot, sometimes speaking for hours in one place, then doing the same in another town.\nEspecially known for his devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus, Bernardine devised a symbol\u2014IHS, the first three letters of the name of Jesus in Greek\u2014in Gothic letters on a blazing sun. This was to displace the superstitious symbols of the day, as well as the insignia of factions: for example, Guelphs and Ghibellines. The devotion spread, and the symbol began to appear in churches, homes and public buildings. Opposition arose from those who thought it a dangerous innovation. Three attempts were made to have the pope take action against him, but Bernardine\u2019s holiness, orthodoxy, and intelligence were evidence of his faithfulness.\nGeneral of the Friars of the Strict Observance, a branch of the Franciscan Order, Bernardine strongly emphasized scholarship and further study of theology and canon law. When he started there were 300 friars in the community; when he died there were 4,000. He returned to preaching the last two years of his life, dying while traveling.\nReflection\nAnother dynamic saint once said, \u201c\u2026I will not be a burden, for I want not what is yours, but you\u2026. I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your sakes\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:14). There is danger that we see only the whirlwind of activity in the Bernardines of faith\u2014taking care of the sick, preaching, studying, administering, always driving\u2014and forget the source of their energy. We should not say that Bernardine could have been a great contemplative if he had had the chance. He had the chance, every day, and he took it.\nSaint Bernardine of Siena is the Patron Saint of:\nAdvertising\nGambling\nItaly\nPublic relations\n\u00a0",

Churches, schools, and seminaries were closed; foreign clergy were expelled. Crist\u00f3bal established a clandestine seminary at Totatiche, Jalisco. He and the other priests were forced to minister secretly to Catholics during the presidency of Plutarco Calles (1924-28).\nAll of these martyrs, except three, were diocesan priests. David, Manuel and Salvador were laymen who died with their parish priest, Luis Batis. They all belonged to the Cristero movement, pledging their allegiance to Christ and to the Church that he established, to spread the Good News in society\u2014even if Mexico\u2019s leaders had made it a crime to receive baptism or celebrate the Mass.\nThese martyrs did not die as a single group but over 22 years time in eight Mexican states, with Jalisco and Zacatecas having the largest number. They were beatified in 1992 and canonized eight years later.\nReflection\nEvery martyr realizes how to avoid execution, but refuses to pay the high price of doing so. A clear conscience was more valuable than a long life. We may be tempted to compromise our faith while telling ourselves that we are simply being realistic, dealing with situations as we find them. Is survival really the ultimate value? Do our concrete, daily choices reflect our deepest values, the ones that allow us to \u201ctick\u201d the way we do?

In 1049, things began to change when Pope Leo IX, a reformer, was elected. He brought a young monk named Hildebrand to Rome as his counselor and special representative on important missions. Hildebrand was to become Gregory VII.\nThree evils plagued the Church then: simony\u2013the buying and selling of sacred offices and things; the unlawful marriage of the clergy; and lay investiture\u2014kings and nobles controlling the appointment of Church officials. To all of these Hildebrand directed his reformer\u2019s attention, first as counselor to the popes and later as pope himself.\nGregory\u2019s papal letters stress the role of the bishop of Rome as the vicar of Christ and the visible center of unity in the Church. He is well known for his long dispute with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV over who should control the selection of bishops and abbots.\nGregory fiercely resisted any attack on the liberty of the Church. For this he suffered and finally died in exile. He said, \u201cI have loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore, I die in exile.\u201d Thirty years later the Church finally won its struggle against lay investiture.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast of Saint Gregory VII is May 25.\nReflection\nThe Gregorian Reform, a milestone in the history of Christ\u2019s Church, was named after this man who tried to extricate the papacy and the whole Church from undue control by civil rulers. Against an unhealthy Church nationalism in some areas, Gregory reasserted the unity of the whole Church based on Christ, and expressed in the bishop of Rome, the successor of Saint Peter.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Mary Magdalene de\u2019 Pazzi\u2019s Story\nMystical ecstasy is the elevation of the spirit to God in such a way that the person is aware of this union with God while both internal and external senses are detached from the sensible world. Mary Magdalene de\u2019 Pazzi was so generously given this special gift of God that she is called the \u201cecstatic saint.\u201d\nCatherine de\u2019 Pazzi was born into a noble family in Florence in 1566. The normal course would have been for her to have married into wealth and enjoyed comfort, but Catherine chose to follow her own path. At 9,\u00a0she learned to meditate from the family confessor. She made her first Communion at the then-early age of 10, and made a vow of virginity one month later. At 16, Catherine entered the Carmelite convent in Florence because she could receive Communion daily there.\nCatherine had taken the name Mary Magdalene and had been a novice for a year when she became critically ill. Death seemed near, so her superiors let her make her profession of vows in a private ceremony from a cot in the chapel. Immediately after, Mary Magdalene fell into an ecstasy that lasted about two hours. This was repeated after Communion on the following 40 mornings. These ecstasies were rich experiences of union with God and contained marvelous insights into divine truths.\nAs a safeguard against deception and to preserve the revelations, her confessor asked Mary Magdalene to dictate her experiences to sister secretaries. Over the next six years, five large volumes were filled. The first three books record ecstasies from May of 1584 through Pentecost week the following year. This week was a preparation for a severe five-year trial. The fourth book records that trial and the fifth is a collection of letters concerning reform and renewal. Another book, Admonitions, is a collection of her sayings arising from her experiences in the formation of women religious.\nThe extraordinary was ordinary for this saint. She read the thoughts of others and predicted future events. During her lifetime, Mary Magdalene appeared to several persons in distant places and cured a number of sick people.\nIt would be easy to dwell on the ecstasies and pretend that Mary Magdalene only had spiritual highs. This is far from true. It seems that God permitted her this special closeness to prepare her for the five years of desolation that followed when she experienced spiritual dryness. She was plunged into a state of darkness in which she saw nothing but what was horrible in herself and all around her. She had violent temptations and endured great physical suffering. Mary Magdalene de\u2019 Pazzi died in 1607 at age 41, and was canonized in 1669.\u00a0Her Liturgical Feast Day is May 25.\nReflection\nIntimate union, God\u2019s gift to mystics, is a reminder to all of us of the eternal happiness of union he wishes to give us. The cause of mystical ecstasy in this life is the Holy Spirit, working through spiritual gifts. The ecstasy occurs because of the weakness of the body and its powers to withstand the divine illumination, but as the body is purified and strengthened, ecstasy no longer occurs. See Teresa of Avila\u2019s\u00a0Interior Castle, and John of the Cross\u2019\u00a0Dark Night of the Soul, for more about various aspects of ecstasies.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSaint Bede the Venerable\u2019s Story\nBede is one of the few saints honored as such even during his lifetime. His writings were filled with such faith and learning that even while he was still alive, a Church council ordered them to be read publicly in the churches.\nAt an early age, Bede was entrusted to the care of the abbot of the Monastery of St. Paul, Jarrow. The happy combination of genius and the instruction of scholarly, saintly monks, produced a saint and an extraordinary scholar, perhaps the most outstanding one of his day. He was deeply versed in all the sciences of his times: natural philosophy, the philosophical principles of Aristotle, astronomy, arithmetic, grammar, ecclesiastical history, the lives of the saints and especially, holy Scripture.\nFrom the time of his ordination to the priesthood at 30\u2014he had been ordained a deacon at 19\u2014till his death, Bede was ever occupied with learning, writing, and teaching. Besides the many books that he copied, he composed 45 of his own, including 30 commentaries on books of the Bible.\nHis Ecclesiastical History of the English People is commonly regarded as of decisive importance in the art and science of writing history. A unique era was coming to an end at the time of Bede\u2019s death: It had fulfilled its purpose of preparing Western Christianity to assimilate the non-Roman barbarian North. Bede recognized the opening to a new day in the life of the Church even as it was happening.\nAlthough eagerly sought by kings and other notables, even Pope Sergius, Bede managed to remain in his own monastery until his death. Only once did he leave for a few months in order to teach in the school of the archbishop of York. Bede died in 735 praying his favorite prayer: \u201cGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As in the beginning, so now, and forever.\u201d\nReflection\nThough his History is the greatest legacy Bede has left us, his work in all the sciences, especially in Scripture, should not be overlooked. During his last Lent, Bede worked on a translation of the Gospel of Saint John into English, completing it the day he died. But of this work \u201cto break the word to the poor and unlearned\u201d nothing remains today.\nSaint Bede the Venerable is the Patron Saint of:\nScholars\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Philip Neri\u2019s Story\nPhilip Neri was a sign of contradiction, combining popularity with piety against the background of a corrupt Rome and a disinterested clergy: the whole post-Renaissance malaise.\nAt an early age, Philip abandoned the chance to become a businessman, moved to Rome from Florence, and devoted his life and individuality to God. After three years of philosophy and theology studies, he gave up any thought of ordination. The next 13 years were spent in a vocation unusual at the time\u2014that of a layperson actively engaged in prayer and the apostolate.\nAs the Council of Trent (1545-63) was reforming the Church on a doctrinal level, Philip\u2019s appealing personality was winning him friends from all levels of society, from beggars to cardinals. He rapidly gathered around himself a group of laypersons won over by his audacious spirituality. Initially, they met as an informal prayer and discussion group, and also served poor people in Rome.\nAt the urging of his confessor, Philip was ordained a priest and soon became an outstanding confessor himself, gifted with the knack of piercing the pretenses and illusions of others, though always in a charitable manner and often with a joke. He arranged talks, discussions, and prayers for his penitents in a room above the church. He sometimes led \u201cexcursions\u201d to other churches, often with music and a picnic on the way.\nSome of Philip\u2019s followers became priests and lived together in community. This was the beginning of the Oratory, the religious institute he founded. A feature of their life was a daily afternoon service of four informal talks, with vernacular hymns and prayers. Giovanni Palestrina was one of Philip\u2019s followers, and composed music for the services.\u00a0The Oratory was finally approved after suffering through a period of accusations of being an assembly of heretics, where laypersons preached and sang vernacular hymns!\nPhilip\u2019s advice was sought by many of the prominent figures of his day. He is one of the influential figures of the Counter-Reformation, mainly for converting to personal holiness many of the influential people within the Church itself. His characteristic virtues were humility and gaiety.\nAfter spending a day hearing confessions and receiving visitors, Philip Neri suffered a hemorrhage and died on the feast of Corpus Christi in 1595. He was beatified in 1615 and canonized in 1622. Three centuries later, Cardinal John Henry Newman founded the first English-speaking house of the Oratory in London.\nReflection\nMany people wrongly feel that such an attractive and jocular personality as Philip\u2019s cannot be combined with an intense spirituality. Philip\u2019s life melts our rigid, narrow views of piety. His approach to sanctity was truly catholic, all-embracing, and accompanied by a good laugh. Philip always wanted his followers to become not less but more human through their striving for holiness.\n\u00a0",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Augustine of Canterbury\u2019s Story\nIn the year 596, some 40 monks set out from Rome to evangelize the Anglo-Saxons in England. Leading the group was Augustine, the prior of their monastery. Hardly had he and his men reached Gaul when they heard stories of the ferocity of the Anglo-Saxons and of the treacherous waters of the English Channel. Augustine returned to Rome and to Gregory the Great\u2014the pope who had sent them\u2014only to be assured by him that their fears were groundless.\nAugustine set out again. This time the group crossed the English Channel and landed in the territory of Kent, ruled by King Ethelbert, a pagan married to a Christian, Bertha. Ethelbert received them kindly, set up a residence for them in Canterbury and within the year, on Pentecost Sunday 597, was himself baptized. After being consecrated a bishop in France, Augustine returned to Canterbury, where he founded his see. He constructed a church and monastery near where the present cathedral, begun in 1070, now stands. As the faith spread, additional sees were established at London and Rochester.\nWork was sometimes slow and Augustine did not always meet with success. Attempts to reconcile the Anglo-Saxon Christians with the original Briton Christians\u2014who had been driven into western England by Anglo-Saxon invaders\u2014ended in dismal failure. Augustine failed to convince the Britons to give up certain Celtic customs at variance with Rome and to forget their bitterness, helping him evangelize their Anglo-Saxon conquerors.\nLaboring patiently, Augustine wisely heeded the missionary principles\u2014quite enlightened for the times\u2014suggested by Pope Gregory: purify rather than destroy pagan temples and customs; let pagan rites and festivals be transformed into Christian feasts; retain local customs as far as possible. The limited success Augustine achieved in England before his death in 605, a short eight years after his arrival, would eventually bear fruit long after in the conversion of England. Augustine of Canterbury can truly be called the \u201cApostle of England.\u201d\nReflection\nAugustine of Canterbury comes across today as a very human saint, one who could suffer like many of us from a failure of nerve. For example, his first venture to England ended in a big U-turn back to Rome. He made mistakes and met failure in his peacemaking attempts with the Briton Christians. He often wrote to Rome for decisions on matters he could have decided on his own had he been more self-assured. He even received mild warnings against pride from Pope Gregory, who cautioned him to \u201cfear lest, amidst the wonders that are done, the weak mind be puffed up by self-esteem.\u201d Augustine\u2019s perseverance amidst obstacles and only partial success teaches today\u2019s apostles and pioneers to struggle on despite frustrations and be satisfied with gradual advances.\nSaint Augustine of Canterbury is the Patron Saint of:\nEngland\nAnother Saint of the Day for May 27 is Blessed Gerard of Lunel.\n\u00a0",

In his early 20s, Pierre, his younger sister, his aunt, and two other house slaves accompanied their master\u2019s son to New York City because of political unrest at home. Apprenticed to a local hairdresser, Pierre learned the trade quickly and eventually worked very successfully in the homes of rich women in New York City.\nWhen his master died, Pierre was determined to support himself, his master\u2019s widow, and the other house slaves.

He attended daily Mass at St. Peter\u2019s Church on Barclay Street, the same parish that Saint\u00a0Elizabeth Ann Seton had attended.\nPierre donated to various charities, generously assisting blacks and whites in need. He and his wife opened their home to orphans and educated them. The couple also nursed abandoned people who were suffering from yellow fever. Urged to retire and enjoy the wealth he had accumulated, Pierre responded, \u201cI have enough for myself, but if I stop working I have not enough for others.\u201d\nPierre originally was buried outside St. Patrick\u2019s Old Cathedral, where he was once refused entrance because of his race.

Himself a seminarian, Louis decided that his younger sister would likewise learn Latin, Greek, history, physics and mathematics\u2014always without interruption and with a minimum of companionship. By age 15, she had received a thorough exposure to the Bible, the teachings of the Fathers of the Church and theology. Despite the oppressive regime Louis imposed, young Sophie thrived and developed a genuine love of learning.\nMeanwhile, this was the time of the French Revolution and of the suppression of Christian schools. The education of the young, particularly young girls, was in a troubled state. Sophie, who had discerned a call to the religious life, was persuaded to become a teacher. She founded the Society of the Sacred Heart, which focused on schools for the poor as well as boarding schools for young women of means. Today, co-ed Sacred Heart schools also can be found, along with schools exclusively for boys.\nIn 1826, her Society of the Sacred Heart received formal papal approval. By then she had served as superior at a number of convents. In 1865, she was stricken with paralysis; she died that year on the feast of the Ascension.\nMadeleine Sophie Barat was canonized in 1925.\nReflection\nMadeleine Sophie Barat lived in turbulent times. She was only 10 when the Reign of Terror began. In the wake of the French Revolution, rich and poor both suffered before some semblance of normality returned to France. Born to some degree of privilege, Sophie received a good education.

This enabled Charles VII to be crowned as king in Reims in 1429. Captured near Compiegne the following year, Joan was sold to the English and placed on trial for heresy and witchcraft. Professors at the University of Paris supported Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvis, the judge at her trial; Cardinal Henry Beaufort of Winchester, England, participated in the questioning of Joan in prison. In the end, she was condemned for wearing men\u2019s clothes. The English resented France\u2019s military success\u2013to which Joan contributed.\nOn this day in 1431, Joan was burned at the stake in Rouen, and her ashes were scattered in the Seine River. A second Church trial 25 years later nullified the earlier verdict, which was reached under political pressure.\nRemembered by most people for her military exploits, Joan had a great love for the sacraments, which strengthened her compassion toward the poor.

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nThis is a fairly late feast, going back only to the 13th or 14th century. It was established widely throughout the Church to pray for unity. The present date of celebration was set in 1969, in order to follow the Annunciation of the Lord and precede the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist.\nLike most feasts of Mary, it is closely connected with Jesus and his saving work. The more visible actors in the visitation drama (see Luke 1:39-45) are Mary and Elizabeth. However, Jesus and John the Baptist steal the scene in a hidden way. Jesus makes John leap with joy\u2014the joy of messianic salvation. Elizabeth, in turn, is filled with the Holy Spirit and addresses words of praise to Mary\u2014words that echo down through the ages.\nIt is helpful to recall that we do not have a journalist\u2019s account of this meeting. Rather Luke, speaking for the Church, gives a prayerful poet\u2019s rendition of the scene. Elizabeth\u2019s praise of Mary as \u201cthe mother of my Lord\u201d can be viewed as the earliest Church\u2019s devotion to Mary. As with all authentic devotion to Mary, Elizabeth\u2019s (the Church\u2019s) words first praise God for what God has done to Mary. Only secondly does she praise Mary for trusting God\u2019s words.\nThen comes the Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55). Here, Mary herself\u2014like the Church\u2014traces all her greatness to God.\nReflection\nOne of the invocations in Mary\u2019s litany is \u201cArk of the Covenant.\u201d Like the Ark of the Covenant of old, Mary brings God\u2019s presence into the lives of other people. As David danced before the Ark, John the Baptist leaps for joy. As the Ark helped to unite the 12 tribes of Israel by being placed in David\u2019s capital, so Mary has the power to unite all Christians in her son. At times, devotion to Mary may have occasioned some divisiveness, but we can hope that authentic devotion will lead all to Christ and therefore, to one another.\n",

Mary has an important role to play in the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. She consents to God\u2019s invitation conveyed by the angel (Luke 1:26-38). Elizabeth proclaims: \u201cMost blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And how does this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\u201d (Luke 1:42-43, emphasis added). Mary\u2019s role as mother of God places her in a unique position in God\u2019s redemptive plan.\nWithout naming Mary, Paul asserts that \u201cGod sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law\u201d (Galatians 4:4). Paul\u2019s further statement that \u201cGod sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out \u2018Abba, Father!\u2019\u201d helps us realize that Mary is mother to all the brothers and sisters of Jesus.\nSome theologians also insist that Mary\u2019s motherhood of Jesus is an important element in God\u2019s creative plan. God\u2019s \u201cfirst\u201d thought in creating was Jesus. Jesus, the incarnate Word, is the one who could give God perfect love and worship on behalf of all creation. As Jesus was \u201cfirst\u201d in God\u2019s mind, Mary was \u201csecond\u201d insofar as she was chosen from all eternity to be his mother.\nThe precise title \u201cMother of God\u201d goes back at least to the third or fourth century. In the Greek form Theotokos\u2014God-bearer\u2014it became the touchstone of the Church\u2019s teaching about the Incarnation. The Council of Ephesus in 431 insisted that the holy Fathers were right in calling the holy virgin Theotokos. At the end of this particular session, crowds of people marched through the street shouting: \u201cPraised be the Theotokos!\u201d The tradition reaches to our own day. In its chapter on Mary\u2019s role in the Church, Vatican II\u2019s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church calls Mary \u201cMother of God\u201d 12 times.\nReflection\nOther themes come together at today\u2019s celebration. It is the Octave of Christmas: Our remembrance of Mary\u2019s divine motherhood injects a further note of Christmas joy. It is a day of prayer for world peace: Mary is the mother of the Prince of Peace. It is the first day of a new year: Mary continues to bring new life to her children\u2014who are also God\u2019s children.\n\n",

After studying various modes of religious life, he founded what was probably the first monastery in Asia Minor. He is to monks of the East what Saint\u00a0Benedict is to the West, and Basil\u2019s principles influence Eastern monasticism today.\nHe was ordained a priest, assisted the archbishop of Caesarea\u2014now southeastern Turkey\u2014and ultimately became archbishop himself, in spite of opposition from some of the bishops under him, probably because they foresaw coming reforms.\nArianism, one of the most damaging heresies in the history of the Church which denied the divinity of Christ, was at its height. Emperor Valens persecuted orthodox believers, and put great pressure on Basil to remain silent and admit the heretics to communion. Basil remained firm, and Valens backed down. But trouble remained. When the great Saint\u00a0Athanasius died, the mantle of defender of the faith against Arianism fell upon Basil. He strove mightily to unite and rally his fellow Catholics who were crushed by tyranny and torn by internal dissension. He was misunderstood, misrepresented, accused of heresy and ambition. Even appeals to the pope brought no response. \u201cFor my sins I seem to be unsuccessful in everything.\u201d\nBasil was tireless in pastoral care. He preached twice a day to huge crowds, built a hospital that was called a wonder of the world\u2014as a youth he had organized famine relief and worked in a soup kitchen himself\u2014and fought the prostitution business.\nBasil was best known as an orator. Though not recognized greatly in his lifetime, his writings rightly place him among the great teachers of the Church.

The devotion grew, partly because of Franciscan and Dominican preachers. It spread even more widely after the Jesuits began promoting it in the 16th century.\nIn 1530, Pope Clement V approved an Office of the Holy Name for the Franciscans. In 1721, Pope Innocent XIII extended this feast to the entire Church.\nReflection\nJesus died and rose for the sake of all people. No one can trademark or copyright Jesus\u2019 name. Jesus is the Son of God and son of Mary. Everything that exists was created in and through the Son of God (see Colossians 1:15-20). The name of Jesus is debased if any Christian uses it as justification for berating non-Christians. Jesus reminds us that because we are all related to him we are, therefore, all related to one another.\n",

She founded the first American religious community for women, the Sisters of Charity. She opened the first American parish school and established the first American Catholic orphanage. All this she did in the span of 46 years while raising her five children.\nElizabeth Ann Bayley Seton is a true daughter of the American Revolution, born August 28, 1774, just two years before the Declaration of Independence. By birth and marriage, she was linked to the first families of New York and enjoyed the fruits of high society. Reared a staunch Episcopalian, she learned the value of prayer, Scripture and a nightly examination of conscience. Her father, Dr. Richard Bayley, did not have much use for churches but was a great humanitarian, teaching his daughter to love and serve others.\nThe early deaths of her mother in 1777 and her baby sister in 1778 gave Elizabeth a feel for eternity and the temporariness of the pilgrim life on earth. Far from being brooding and sullen, she faced each new \u201cholocaust,\u201d as she put it, with hopeful cheerfulness.\nAt 19, Elizabeth was the belle of New York and married a handsome, wealthy businessman, William Magee Seton. They had five children before his business failed and he died of tuberculosis. At 30, Elizabeth was widowed, penniless, with five small children to support.\nWhile in Italy with her dying husband, Elizabeth witnessed Catholicity in action through family friends. Three basic points led her to become a Catholic: belief in the Real Presence, devotion to the Blessed Mother and conviction that the Catholic Church led back to the apostles and to Christ. Many of her family and friends rejected her when she became a Catholic in March 1805.\nTo support her children, she opened a school in Baltimore. From the beginning, her group followed the lines of a religious community, which was officially founded in 1809.\nThe thousand or more letters of Mother Seton reveal the development of her spiritual life from ordinary goodness to heroic sanctity. She suffered great trials of sickness, misunderstanding, the death of loved ones (her husband and two young daughters) and the heartache of a wayward son. She died January 4, 1821, and became the first American-born citizen to be beatified (1963) and then canonized (1975). She is buried in Emmitsburg, Maryland.\nReflection\nElizabeth Seton had no extraordinary gifts. She was not a mystic or stigmatic. She did not prophesy or speak in tongues. She had two great devotions: abandonment to the will of God and an ardent love for the Blessed Sacrament. She wrote to a friend, Julia Scott, that she would prefer to exchange the world for a \u201ccave or a desert.\u201d \u201cBut God has given me a great deal to do, and I have always and hope always to prefer his will to every wish of my own.\u201d Her brand of sanctity is open to everyone if we love God and do his will.\nSaint Elizabeth Ann Seton is the Patron Saint of:\nCatholic School\nLoss of Parents\n",

After studying in Prague, he came to New York at 25 and was ordained a priest. He did missionary work in New York until he was 29, when he joined the Redemptorists and became its first member to profess vows in the United States. He continued missionary work in Maryland, Virginia and Ohio, where he became popular with the Germans.\nAt 41, as bishop of Philadelphia, he organized the parochial school system into a diocesan one, increasing the number of pupils almost twentyfold within a short time.\nGifted with outstanding organizing ability, he drew into the city many teaching communities of sisters and the Christian Brothers. During his brief assignment as vice provincial for the Redemptorists, he placed them in the forefront of the parochial movement.\nWell-known for his holiness and learning, spiritual writing and preaching, on October 13, 1963, John Neumann became the first American bishop to be beatified. Canonized in 1977, he is buried in St. Peter the Apostle Church in Philadelphia.\nReflection\nNeumann took seriously our Lord\u2019s words, \u201cGo and teach all nations.\u201d From Christ he received his instructions and the power to carry them out. For Christ does not give a mission without supplying the means to accomplish it. The Father\u2019s gift in Christ to John Neumann was his exceptional organizing ability, which he used to spread the Good News. Today the Church is in dire need of men and women to continue in our times the teaching of the Good News. The obstacles and inconveniences are real and costly. Yet when Christians approach Christ, he supplies the necessary talents to answer today\u2019s needs. The Spirit of Christ continues his work through the instrumentality of generous Christians.\n",

He was the eighth of 12 children born to a French Canadian couple near Montreal. Adopted at 12, when both parents had died, he became a farmhand. Various trades followed: shoemaker, baker, blacksmith\u2014all failures. He was a factory worker in the United States during the boom times of the Civil War.\nAt 25, Andr\u00e9 applied for entrance into the Congregation of Holy Cross. After a year\u2019s novitiate, he was not admitted because of his weak health. But with an extension and the urging of Bishop Bourget, he was finally received. He was given the humble job of doorkeeper at Notre Dame College in Montreal, with additional duties as sacristan, laundry worker and messenger. \u201cWhen I joined this community, the superiors showed me the door, and I remained 40 years,\u201d he said.\nIn his little room near the door, he spent much of the night on his knees. On his windowsill, facing Mount Royal, was a small statue of Saint\u00a0Joseph, to whom he had been devoted since childhood. When asked about it he said, \u201cSome day, Saint\u00a0Joseph is going to be honored in a very special way on Mount Royal!\u201d\nWhen he heard someone was ill, he visited to bring cheer and to pray with the sick person. He would rub the sick person lightly with oil taken from a lamp burning in the college chapel. Word of healing powers began to spread.\nWhen an epidemic broke out at a nearby college, Andr\u00e9 volunteered to nurse. Not one person died. The trickle of sick people to his door became a flood. His superiors were uneasy; diocesan authorities were suspicious; doctors called him a quack. \u201cI do not cure,\u201d he said again and again. \u201cSaint\u00a0Joseph cures.\u201d In the end he needed four secretaries to handle the 80,000 letters he received each year.\nFor many years the Holy Cross authorities had tried to buy land on Mount Royal. Brother Andr\u00e9 and others climbed the steep hill and planted medals of Saint\u00a0Joseph. Suddenly, the owners yielded. Andr\u00e9 collected $200 to build a small chapel and began receiving visitors there\u2014smiling through long hours of listening, applying Saint\u00a0Joseph\u2019s oil. Some were cured, some not. The pile of crutches, canes and braces grew.\nThe chapel also grew. By 1931, there were gleaming walls, but money ran out. \u201cPut a statue of Saint\u00a0Joseph in the middle. If he wants a roof over his head, he\u2019ll get it.\u201d The magnificent Oratory on Mount Royal took 50 years to build. The sickly boy who could not hold a job died at 92.\nHe is buried at the Oratory. He was beatified in 1982 and canonized in 2010. At his canonization in October 2010, Pope Benedict XVI said that Saint\u00a0Andre \u201clived the beatitude of the pure of heart.\u201d\nReflection\nRubbing ailing limbs with oil or a medal? Planting a medal to buy land? Isn\u2019t this superstition? Aren\u2019t we long past that?\u00a0Superstitious people rely only on the \u201cmagic\u201d of a word or action. Brother Andr\u00e9\u2019s oil and medals were authentic sacramentals of a simple, total faith in the Father who lets his saints help him bless his children.\n",

As a member of the Spanish nobility, he had the resources and the education to get a good start in life.\nBy the time he was 20, he was teaching philosophy. In his early 30s he earned a doctorate in both canon and civil law. At 41 he became a Dominican. Pope Gregory IX called him to Rome to work for him and to be his confessor. One of the things the pope asked him to do was to gather together all the decrees of popes and councils that had been made in 80 years since a similar collection by Gratian. Raymond compiled five books called the Decretals. They were looked upon as one of the best organized collections of Church law until the 1917 codification of canon law.\nEarlier, Raymond had written for confessors a book of cases. It was called Summa de Casibus Poenitentiae. More than simply a list of sins and penances, it discussed pertinent doctrines and laws of the Church that pertained to the problem or case brought to the confessor.\nAt the age of 60, Raymond was appointed archbishop of Tarragona, the capital of Aragon. He didn\u2019t like the honor at all and ended up getting sick and resigning in two years.\nHe didn\u2019t get to enjoy his peace long, however, because when he was 63 he was elected by his fellow Dominicans to be the head of the whole Order, the successor of Saint\u00a0Dominic. Raymond worked hard, visited on foot all the Dominicans, reorganized their constitutions and managed to put through a provision that a master general be allowed to resign. When the new constitutions were accepted, Raymond, then 65, resigned.\nHe still had 35 years to oppose heresy and work for the conversion of the Moors in Spain. He convinced Saint\u00a0Thomas Aquinas to write his work Against the Gentiles.\nIn his 100th year, the Lord let Raymond retire.\nReflection\nRaymond was a lawyer, a canonist. Legalism can suck the life out of genuine religion if it becomes too great a preoccupation with the letter of the law to the neglect of the spirit and purpose of the law. The law can become an end in itself, so that the value the law was intended to promote is overlooked. But we must guard against going to the opposite extreme and seeing law as useless or something to be lightly regarded. Laws ideally state those things that are for the best interests of everyone and make sure the rights of all are safeguarded. From Raymond, we can learn a respect for law as a means of serving the common good.\nSaint\u00a0Raymond of Pe\u00f1afort is the Patron Saint of:\nLawyers\n",

Her Franciscan confessor helped Angela to seek God\u2019s pardon for her previous life and to dedicate herself to prayer and the works of charity.\nShortly after her conversion, her husband and children died. Selling most of her possessions, she entered the Secular Franciscan Order. She was alternately absorbed by meditating on the crucified Christ and by serving the poor of Foligno as a nurse and beggar for their needs. Other women joined her in a religious community.\nAt her confessor\u2019s advice, Angela wrote her Book of Visions and Instructions. In it she recalls some of the temptations she suffered after her conversion; she also expresses her thanks to God for the Incarnation of Jesus. This book and her life earned for Angela the title \u201cTeacher of Theologians.\u201d She was beatified in 1693, and canonized in 2013.\nReflection\nPeople who live in the United States today can understand Saint\u00a0Angela\u2019s temptation to increase her sense of self-worth by accumulating money, fame or power.

Adrian accepted, but ended up spending most of his life and doing most of his work in Canterbury.\nBorn in Africa, Adrian was serving as an abbot in Italy when the new Archbishop of Canterbury appointed him abbot of the monastery of Saints\u00a0Peter and Paul in Canterbury. Thanks to his leadership skills, the facility became one of the most important centers of learning. The school attracted many outstanding scholars from far and wide and produced numerous future bishops and archbishops. Students reportedly learned Greek and Latin and spoke Latin as well as their own native languages.\nAdrian taught at the school for 40 years. He died there, probably in the year 710, and was buried in the monastery. Several hundred years later, when reconstruction was being done, Adrian\u2019s body was discovered in an incorrupt state. As word spread, people flocked to his tomb, which became famous for miracles.

Gregory\u2019s success in his studies suggested great things were ahead for him. After becoming a professor of rhetoric, he was persuaded to devote his learning and efforts to the Church. By then married, Gregory went on to study for the priesthood and become ordained (this at a time when celibacy was not a matter of law for priests).\nHe was elected Bishop of Nyssa in 372, a period of great tension over the Arian heresy, which denied the divinity of Christ. Briefly arrested after being falsely accused of embezzling Church funds, Gregory was restored to his see in 378, an act met with great joy by his people.\nIt was after the death of his beloved brother, Basil, that Gregory really came into his own. He wrote with great effectiveness against Arianism and other questionable doctrines, gaining a reputation as a defender of orthodoxy. He was sent on missions to counter other heresies and held a position of prominence at the Council of Constantinople. His fine reputation stayed with him for the remainder of his life, but over the centuries it gradually declined as the authorship of his writings became less and less certain. But, thanks to the work of scholars in the 20th century, his stature is once again appreciated. Indeed, Saint\u00a0Gregory of Nyssa is seen not simply as a pillar of orthodoxy but as one of the great contributors to the mystical tradition in Christian spirituality and to monasticism itself.\nReflection\nOrthodoxy is a word that can raise red flags in our minds. To some people it may connote rigid attitudes that make no room for honest differences of opinion. But it might just as well suggest something else: faith that has settled deep in one\u2019s bones. Gregory\u2019s faith was like that. So deeply embedded was his faith in Jesus that he knew the divinity that Arianism denied. When we resist something offered as truth without knowing exactly why, it may be because our faith has settled in our bones.\nAnother Saint of the Day for January 10 is Servant of God Vico Necchi.\n",

Children from European as well as Native American backgrounds in 17th-century Canada benefited from her great zeal and unshakable trust in God\u2019s providence.\nBorn the sixth of 12 children in Troyes, France, Marguerite at the age of 20 believed that she was called to religious life. Her applications to the Carmelites and Poor Clares were unsuccessful. A priest friend suggested that perhaps God had other plans for her.\nIn 1654, the governor of the French settlement in Canada visited his sister, an Augustinian canoness in Troyes. Marguerite belonged to a sodality connected to that convent. The governor invited her to come to Canada and start a school in Ville-Marie (eventually the city of Montreal). When she arrived, the colony numbered 200 people with a hospital and a Jesuit mission chapel.\nSoon after starting a school, she realized her need for coworkers. Returning to Troyes, she recruited a friend, Catherine Crolo, and two other young women. In 1667, they added classes at their school for Indian children. A second trip to France three years later resulted in six more young women and a letter from King Louis XIV, authorizing the school. The Congregation of Notre Dame was established in 1676 but its members did not make formal religious profession until 1698 when their Rule and constitutions were approved.\nMarguerite established a school for Indian girls in Montreal.

Saint\u00a0Jerome said \u201cThe world groaned and marveled to find that it was Arian.\u201d When Emperor Constantius ordered all the bishops of the West to sign a condemnation of Athanasius, the great defender of the faith in the East, Hilary refused and was banished from France to far off Phrygia. Eventually he was called the \u201cAthanasius of the West.\u201d\nWhile writing in exile, he was invited by some semi-Arians (hoping for reconciliation) to a council the emperor called to counteract the Council of Nicea. But Hilary predictably defended the Church, and when he sought public debate with the heretical bishop who had exiled him, the Arians, dreading the meeting and its outcome, pleaded with the emperor to send this troublemaker back home. Hilary was welcomed by his people.\nReflection\nChrist said his coming would bring not peace but a sword (see Matthew 10:34). The Gospels offer no support for us if we fantasize about a sunlit holiness that knows no problems. Christ did not escape at the last moment, though he did live happily ever after\u2014after a life of controversy, problems, pain and frustration. Hilary, like all saints, simply had more of the same.\n\u00a0\n",

The solitude was broken when Gregory\u2019s father, a bishop, needed help in his diocese and estate. It seems that Gregory was ordained a priest practically by force, and only reluctantly accepted the responsibility. He skillfully avoided a schism that threatened when his own father made compromises with Arianism. At 41, Gregory was chosen suffragan bishop of Caesarea and at once came into conflict with Valens, the emperor, who supported the Arians.\nAn unfortunate by-product of the battle was the cooling of the friendship of two saints. Basil, his archbishop, sent him to a miserable and unhealthy town on the border of unjustly created divisions in his diocese. Basil reproached Gregory for not going to his see.\nWhen protection for Arianism ended with the death of Valens, Gregory was called to rebuild the faith in the great see of Constantinople, which had been under Arian teachers for three decades. Retiring and sensitive, he dreaded being drawn into the whirlpool of corruption and violence. He first stayed at a friend\u2019s home, which became the only orthodox church in the city. In such surroundings, he began giving the great sermons on the Trinity for which he is famous. In time, Gregory did rebuild the faith in the city, but at the cost of great suffering, slander, insults, and even personal violence. An interloper even tried to take over his bishopric.\nHis last days were spent in solitude and austerity. He wrote religious poetry, some of it autobiographical, of great depth and beauty. He was acclaimed simply as \u201cthe Theologian.\u201d\nReflection\nIt may be small comfort, but post-Vatican II turmoil in the Church is a mild storm compared to the devastation caused by the Arian heresy, a trauma the Church has never forgotten. Christ did not promise the kind of peace we would love to have\u2014no problems, no opposition, no pain. In one way or another, holiness is always the way of the cross.\n",

He was also a learned and devout young man. During the persecution of Decius in Egypt in the year 250, Paul was forced to hide in the home of a friend. Fearing a brother-in-law would betray him, he fled in a cave in the desert. His plan was to return once the persecution ended, but the sweetness of solitude and heavenly contemplation convinced him to stay.\nHe went on to live in that cave for the next 90 years. A nearby spring gave him drink, a palm tree furnished him clothing and nourishment. After 21 years of solitude, a bird began bringing him half of a loaf of bread each day. Without knowing what was happening in the world, Paul prayed that the world would become a better place.\nSaint\u00a0Anthony of Egypt attests to his holy life and death. Tempted by the thought that no one had served God in the wilderness longer than he, Anthony was led by God to find Paul and acknowledge him as a man more perfect than himself. The raven that day brought a whole loaf of bread instead of the usual half. As Paul predicted, Anthony would return to bury his new friend.\nThought to have been about 112 when he died, Paul is known as the \u201cFirst Hermit.\u201d His feast day is celebrated in the East; he is also commemorated in the Coptic and Armenian rites of the Mass.\nReflection\nThe will and direction of God are seen in the circumstances of our lives. Led by the grace of God, we are free to respond with choices that bring us closer to and make us more dependent upon the God who created us. Those choices might at times seem to lead us away from our neighbor. But ultimately they lead us back both in prayer and in fellowship to one another.\n",

Leaving one\u2019s homeland and adjusting to new cultures, governments and languages is difficult enough; but martyrdom caps all the other sacrifices.\nIn 1219, with the blessing of Saint\u00a0Francis, Berard left Italy with Peter, Adjute, Accurs, Odo and Vitalis to preach in Morocco. En route in Spain, Vitalis became sick and commanded the other friars to continue their mission without him.\nThey tried preaching in Seville, then in Muslim hands, but made no converts. They went on to Morocco where they preached in the marketplace. The friars were immediately apprehended and ordered to leave the country; they refused. When they began preaching again, an exasperated sultan ordered them executed. After enduring severe beatings and declining various bribes to renounce their faith in Jesus Christ, the friars were beheaded by the sultan himself on January 16, 1220.\nThese were the first Franciscan martyrs. When Francis heard of their deaths, he exclaimed, \u201cNow I can truly say that I have five Friars Minor!\u201d Their relics were brought to Portugal where they prompted a young Augustinian canon to join the Franciscans and set off for Morocco the next year. That young man was Anthony of Padua. These five martyrs were canonized in 1481.\nReflection\nThe deaths of Berard and his companions sparked a missionary vocation in Anthony of Padua and others. There have been many, many Franciscans who have responded to Francis\u2019 challenge. Proclaiming the gospel can be fatal, but that has not stopped the Franciscan men and women who even today risk their lives in many countries throughout the world.\n",

At 20, Anthony was so moved by the Gospel message, \u201cGo, sell what you have, and give to [the] poor\u201d (Mark 10:21b), that he actually did just that with his large inheritance. He is different from Francis in that most of Anthony\u2019s life was spent in solitude. He saw the world completely covered with snares, and gave the Church and the world the witness of solitary asceticism, great personal mortification and prayer. But no saint is antisocial, and Anthony drew many people to himself for spiritual healing and guidance.\nAt 54, he responded to many requests and founded a sort of monastery of scattered cells. Again, like Francis, he had great fear of \u201cstately buildings and well-laden tables.\u201d\nAt 60, he hoped to be a martyr in the renewed Roman persecution of 311, fearlessly exposing himself to danger while giving moral and material support to those in prison. At 88, he was fighting the Arian heresy, that massive trauma from which it took the Church centuries to recover. \u201cThe mule kicking over the altar\u201d denied the divinity of Christ.\nAnthony is associated in art with a T-shaped cross, a pig and a book. The pig and the cross are symbols of his valiant warfare with the devil\u2014the cross his constant means of power over evil spirits, the pig a symbol of the devil himself. The book recalls his preference for \u201cthe book of nature\u201d over the printed word. Anthony died in solitude at age 105.\nReflection\nIn an age that smiles at the notion of devils and angels, a person known for having power over evil spirits must at least make us pause. And in a day when people speak of life as a \u201crat race,\u201d one who devotes a whole life to solitude and prayer points to an essential of the Christian life in all ages. Anthony\u2019s hermit life reminds us of the absoluteness of our break with sin and the totality of our commitment to Christ. Even in God\u2019s good world, there is another world whose false values constantly tempt us.\nSaint Anthony of Egypt is the Patron Saint of:\nButchers\nGravediggers\nSkin Diseases\n",

God had something better for this 17th-century successor to Brother Juniper.\nBorn in Sezze, southeast of Rome, Charles was inspired by the lives of Salvator Horta and Paschal Baylon to become a Franciscan; he did that in 1635. Charles tells us in his autobiography, \u201cOur Lord put in my heart a determination to become a lay brother with a great desire to be poor and to beg alms for his love.\u201d\nCharles served as cook, porter, sacristan, gardener and beggar at various friaries in Italy. In some ways, he was \u201can accident waiting to happen.\u201d He once started a huge fire in the kitchen when the oil in which he was frying onions burst into flames.\nOne story shows how thoroughly Charles adopted the spirit of Saint\u00a0Francis. The superior ordered Charles\u2014then porter\u2014to give food only to traveling friars who came to the door. Charles obeyed this direction; simultaneously the alms to the friars decreased. Charles convinced the superior the two facts were related. When the friars resumed giving goods to all who asked at the door, alms to the friars increased also.\nAt the direction of his confessor, Charles wrote his autobiography, The Grandeurs of the Mercies of God. He also wrote several other spiritual books. He made good use of his various spiritual directors throughout the years; they helped him discern which of Charles\u2019 ideas or ambitions were from God. Charles himself was sought out for spiritual advice. The dying Pope Clement IX called Charles to his bedside for a blessing.\nCharles had a firm sense of God\u2019s providence. Father Severino Gori has said, \u201cBy word and example he recalled in all the need of pursuing only that which is eternal\u201d (Leonard Perotti, St. Charles of Sezze: An Autobiography, page 215).\nHe died at San Francesco a Ripa in Rome and was buried there. Pope John XXIII canonized him in 1959.\nReflection\nThe drama in the lives of the saints is mostly interior. Charles\u2019 life was spectacular only in his cooperation with God\u2019s grace. He was captivated by God\u2019s majesty and great mercy to all of us.\n\n",

Devotion to him spread rapidly, and he is mentioned in several martyrologies as early as 350.\nThe legend of Saint\u00a0Sebastian is important in art, and there is a vast iconography. Scholars now agree that a pious fable has Sebastian entering the Roman army because only there could he assist the martyrs without arousing suspicion. Finally he was found out, brought before Emperor Diocletian and delivered to Mauritanian archers to be shot to death. His body was pierced with arrows, and he was left for dead. But he was found still alive by those who came to bury him. He recovered, but refused to flee.\nOne day he took up a position near where the emperor was to pass. He accosted the emperor, denouncing him for his cruelty to Christians. This time the sentence of death was carried out. Sebastian was beaten to death with clubs.

His Acts have been rather freely colored by the imagination of their compiler. But Saint\u00a0Augustine, in one of his sermons on Saint\u00a0Vincent, speaks of having the Acts of his martyrdom before him. We are at least sure of his name, his being a deacon, the place of his death and burial.\nAccording to the story we have, the unusual devotion he inspired must have had a basis in a very heroic life. Vincent was ordained deacon by his friend Saint\u00a0Valerius of Zaragossa in Spain. The Roman emperors had published their edicts against the clergy in 303, and the following year against the laity. Vincent and his bishop were imprisoned in Valencia. Hunger and torture failed to break them. Like the youths in the fiery furnace, they seemed to thrive on suffering.\nValerius was sent into exile, and Dacian, the Roman governor, now turned the full force of his fury on Vincent. Tortures that sound very modern were tried. But their main effect was the progressive disintegration of Dacian himself. He had the torturers beaten because they failed.\nFinally he suggested a compromise: Would Vincent at least give up the sacred books to be burned according to the emperor\u2019s edict? He would not. Torture on the gridiron continued, the prisoner remaining courageous, the torturer losing control of himself. Vincent was thrown into a filthy prison cell\u2014and converted the jailer. Dacian wept with rage, but strangely enough, ordered the prisoner to be given some rest.\nFriends among the faithful came to visit him, but he was to have no earthly rest. When they finally settled him on a comfortable bed, he went to his eternal rest.\nReflection\nThe martyrs are heroic examples of what God\u2019s power can do. It is humanly impossible, we realize, for someone to go through tortures such as Vincent had and remain faithful. But it is equally true that by human power alone no one can remain faithful even without torture or suffering. God does not come to our rescue at isolated, \u201cspecial\u201d moments. God is supporting the super-cruisers as well as children\u2019s toy boats.\n\n",

Her courage helped tremendously to improve the lives of its victims in Hawaii, a territory annexed to the United States during her lifetime (1898).\nMother Marianne\u2019s generosity and courage were celebrated at her May 14, 2005, beatification in Rome. She was a woman who spoke \u201cthe language of truth and love\u201d to the world, said Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Saraiva Martins, prefect of the Congregation for Saints\u2019 Causes. Cardinal Martins, who presided at the beatification Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, called her life \u201ca wonderful work of divine grace.\u201d Speaking of her special love for persons suffering from leprosy, he said, \u201cShe saw in them the suffering face of Jesus. Like the Good Samaritan, she became their mother.\u201d\nOn January 23, 1838, a daughter was born to Peter and Barbara Cope of Hessen-Darmstadt, Germany. The girl was named after her mother. Two years later the Cope family emigrated to the United States and settled in Utica, New York. Young Barbara worked in a factory until August 1862, when she went to the Sisters of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Syracuse, New York. After profession in November of the next year, she began teaching at Assumption parish school.\nMarianne held the post of superior in several places and was twice the novice mistress of her congregation. A natural leader, three different times she was superior of St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Syracuse, where she learned much that would be useful during her years in Hawaii.\nElected provincial in 1877, Mother Marianne was unanimously re-elected in 1881. Two years later the Hawaiian government was searching for someone to run the Kakaako Receiving Station for people suspected of having leprosy. More than 50 religious communities in the United States and Canada were asked. When the request was put to the Syracuse sisters, 35 of them volunteered immediately. On October 22, 1883, Mother Marianne and six other sisters left for Hawaii where they took charge of the Kakaako Receiving Station outside Honolulu; on the island of Maui they also opened a hospital and a school for girls.\nIn 1888, Mother Marianne and two sisters went to Molokai to open a home for \u201cunprotected women and girls\u201d there. The Hawaiian government was quite hesitant to send women for this difficult assignment; they need not have worried about Mother Marianne! On Molokai she took charge of the home that Saint Damien de Veuster had established for men and boys. Mother Marianne changed life on Molokai by introducing cleanliness, pride, and fun to the colony. Bright scarves and pretty dresses for the women were part of her approach.\nAwarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani by the Hawaiian government and celebrated in a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson, Mother Marianne continued her work faithfully. Her sisters have attracted vocations among the Hawaiian people and still work on Molokai.\nMother Marianne died on August 9, 1918 and was beatified in 2005 and canonized seven years later.\nReflection\nThe government authorities were reluctant to allow Mother Marianne to be a mother on Molokai. Thirty years of dedication proved their fears unfounded. God grants gifts regardless of human shortsightedness and allows those gifts to flower for the sake of the kingdom.\n\n",

For this reason Francis was sent to Padua to study law. After receiving his doctorate, he returned home and, in due time, told his parents he wished to enter the priesthood. His father strongly opposed Francis in this, and only after much patient persuasiveness on the part of the gentle Francis did his father finally consent. Francis was ordained and elected provost of the Diocese of Geneva, then a center for the Calvinists. Francis set out to convert them, especially in the district of Chablais. By preaching and distributing the little pamphlets he wrote to explain true Catholic doctrine, he had remarkable success.\nAt 35, he became bishop of Geneva. While administering his diocese he continued to preach, hear confessions, and catechize the children. His gentle character was a great asset in winning souls. He practiced his own axiom, \u201cA spoonful of honey attracts more flies than a barrelful of vinegar.\u201d\nBesides his two well-known books, the Introduction to the Devout Life and A Treatise on the Love of God, he wrote many pamphlets and carried on a vast correspondence. For his writings, he has been named patron of the Catholic Press. His writings, filled with his characteristic gentle spirit, are addressed to lay people. He wants to make them understand that they too are called to be saints. As he wrote in The Introduction to the Devout Life: \u201cIt is an error, or rather a heresy, to say devotion is incompatible with the life of a soldier, a tradesman, a prince, or a married woman\u2026. It has happened that many have lost perfection in the desert who had preserved it in the world.\u201d\nIn spite of his busy and comparatively short life, he had time to collaborate with another saint, Jane Frances de Chantal, in the work of establishing the Sisters of the Visitation. These women were to practice the virtues exemplified in Mary\u2019s visit to Elizabeth: humility, piety, and mutual charity.

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nThe Story of the Conversion of Saint Paul\nSaint Paul\u2019s entire life can be explained in terms of one experience\u2014his meeting with Jesus on the road to Damascus. In an instant, he saw that all the zeal of his dynamic personality was being wasted, like the strength of a boxer swinging wildly. Perhaps he had never seen Jesus, who was only a few years older. But he had acquired a zealot\u2019s hatred of all Jesus stood for, as he began to harass the Church: \u201c\u2026entering house after house and dragging out men and women, he handed them over for imprisonment\u201d (Acts 8:3b). Now he himself was \u201centered,\u201d possessed, all his energy harnessed to one goal\u2014being a slave of Christ in the ministry of reconciliation, an instrument to help others experience the one Savior.\nOne sentence determined his theology: \u201cI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting\u201d (Acts 9:5b). Jesus was mysteriously identified with people\u2014the loving group of people Saul had been running down like criminals. Jesus, he saw, was the mysterious fulfillment of all he had been blindly pursuing.\nFrom then on, his only work was to \u201cpresent everyone perfect in Christ. For this I labor and struggle, in accord with the exercise of his power working within me\u201d (Colossians 1:28b-29). \u201cFor our gospel did not come to you in word alone, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and [with] much conviction\u201d (1 Thessalonians 1:5a).\nPaul\u2019s life became a tireless proclaiming and living out of the message of the cross: Christians die baptismally to sin and are buried with Christ; they are dead to all that is sinful and unredeemed in the world. They are made into a new creation, already sharing Christ\u2019s victory and someday to rise from the dead like him. Through this risen Christ the Father pours out the Spirit on them, making them completely new.\nSo Paul\u2019s great message to the world was: You are saved entirely by God, not by anything you can do. Saving faith is the gift of total, free, personal and loving commitment to Christ, a commitment that then bears fruit in more \u201cworks\u201d than the Law could ever contemplate.\nReflection\nPaul is undoubtedly hard to understand. His style often reflects the rabbinical style of argument of his day, and often his thought skips on mountaintops while we plod below. But perhaps our problems are accentuated by the fact that so many beautiful jewels have become part of the everyday coin in our Christian language.\n",

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nSaints Timothy and Titus\u2019 Story\nWhat we know from the New Testament of Timothy\u2019s life makes it sound like that of a modern harried bishop. He had the honor of being a fellow apostle with Paul, both sharing the privilege of preaching the gospel and suffering for it.\nTimothy had a Greek father and a Jewish mother named Eunice. Being the product of a \u201cmixed\u201d marriage, he was considered illegitimate by the Jews. It was his grandmother, Lois, who first became Christian. Timothy was a convert of Paul around the year 47 and later joined him in his apostolic work. He was with Paul at the founding of the Church in Corinth. During the 15 years he worked with Paul, he became one of his most faithful and trusted friends. He was sent on difficult missions by Paul\u2014often in the face of great disturbance in local churches which Paul had founded.\nTimothy was with Paul in Rome during the latter\u2019s house arrest. At some period Timothy himself was in prison (Hebrews 13:23). Paul installed him as his representative at the Church of Ephesus.\nTimothy was comparatively young for the work he was doing. Several references seem to indicate that he was timid. And one of Paul\u2019s most frequently quoted lines was addressed to him: \u201cStop drinking only water, but have a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent illnesses\u201d (1 Timothy 5:23).\nTitus has the distinction of being a close friend and disciple of Paul as well as a fellow missionary. He was Greek, apparently from Antioch. Even though Titus was a Gentile, Paul would not let him be forced to undergo circumcision at Jerusalem. Titus is seen as a peacemaker, administrator, great friend. Paul\u2019s second letter to Corinth affords an insight into the depth of his friendship with Titus, and the great fellowship they had in preaching the gospel.\nWhen Paul was having trouble with the community at Corinth, Titus was the bearer of Paul\u2019s severe letter and was successful in smoothing things out. Paul writes he was strengthened not only by the arrival of Titus but also \u201cby the encouragement with which he was encouraged in regard to you, as he told us of your yearning, your lament, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more\u2026. And his heart goes out to you all the more, as he remembers the obedience of all of you, when you received him with fear and trembling\u201d (2 Corinthians 7:7a, 15).\nThe Letter to Titus addresses him as the administrator of the Christian community on the island of Crete, charged with organizing it, correcting abuses, and appointing presbyter-bishops.\nReflection\nIn Titus we get another glimpse of life in the early Church: great zeal in the apostolate, great communion in Christ, great friendship. Yet always there is the problem of human nature and the unglamorous details of daily life: the need for charity and patience in \u201cquarrels with others, fears within myself,\u201d as Paul says. Through it all, the love of Christ sustained them. At the end of the Letter to Titus, Paul says that when the temporary substitute comes, \u201churry to me.\u201d\nSaints Timothy and Titus are the Patron Saints of:\nStomach Disorders\n\n",

Early in life she was appalled at the ignorance among poorer children, whose parents could not or would not teach them the elements of religion. Angela\u2019s charming manner and good looks complemented her natural qualities of leadership. Others joined her in giving regular instruction to the little girls of their neighborhood.\nShe was invited to live with a family in Brescia (where, she had been told in a vision, she would one day found a religious community). Her work continued and became well known. She became the center of a group of people with similar ideals.\nShe eagerly took the opportunity for a trip to the Holy Land. When they had gotten as far as Crete, she was struck with blindness. Her friends wanted to return home, but she insisted on going through with the pilgrimage, and visited the sacred shrines with as much devotion and enthusiasm as if she had her sight. On the way back, while praying before a crucifix, her sight was restored at the same place where it had been lost.\nAt 57, she organized a group of 12 girls to help her in catechetical work. Four years later the group had increased to 28. She formed them into the Company of Saint\u00a0Ursula (patroness of medieval universities and venerated as a leader of women) for the purpose of re-Christianizing family life through solid Christian education of future wives and mothers. The members continued to live at home, had no special habit and took no formal vows, though the early Rule prescribed the practice of virginity, poverty, and obedience. The idea of a teaching congregation of women was new and took time to develop. The community thus existed as a \u201csecular institute\u201d until some years after Angela\u2019s death.\nReflection\nAs with so many saints, history is mostly concerned with their activities. But we must always presume deep Christian faith and love in one whose courage lasts a lifetime, and who can take bold new steps when human need demands.\n",

        "about": "\n\u00a0\nSaint Thomas Aquinas\u2019 Story\nBy universal consent, Thomas Aquinas is the preeminent spokesman of the Catholic tradition of reason and of divine revelation. He is one of the great teachers of the medieval Catholic Church, honored with the titles Doctor of the Church and Angelic Doctor.\nAt five he was given to the Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino in his parents\u2019 hopes that he would choose that way of life and eventually became abbot. In 1239, he was sent to Naples to complete his studies. It was here that he was first attracted to Aristotle\u2019s philosophy.\nBy 1243, Thomas abandoned his family\u2019s plans for him and joined the Dominicans, much to his mother\u2019s dismay. On her order, Thomas was captured by his brother and kept at home for over a year.\nOnce free, he went to Paris and then to Cologne, where he finished his studies with Albert the Great. He held two professorships at Paris, lived at the court of Pope Urban IV, directed the Dominican schools at Rome and Viterbo, combated adversaries of the mendicants, as well as the Averroists, and argued with some Franciscans about Aristotelianism.\nHis greatest contribution to the Catholic Church is his writings. The unity, harmony, and continuity of faith and reason, of revealed and natural human knowledge, pervades his writings. One might expect Thomas, as a man of the gospel, to be an ardent defender of revealed truth. But he was broad enough, deep enough, to see the whole natural order as coming from God the Creator, and to see reason as a divine gift to be highly cherished.\nThe Summa Theologiae, his last and, unfortunately, uncompleted work, deals with the whole of Catholic theology. He stopped work on it after celebrating Mass on December 6, 1273. When asked why he stopped writing, he replied, \u201cI cannot go on\u2026. All that I have written seems to me like so much straw compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me.\u201d He died March 7, 1274.\nReflection\nWe can look to Thomas Aquinas as a towering example of Catholicism in the sense of broadness, universality, and inclusiveness. We should be determined anew to exercise the divine gift of reason in us, our power to know, learn, and understand. At the same time we should thank God for the gift of his revelation, especially in Jesus Christ.\nSaint Thomas Aquinas is the Patron Saint of:\nCatholic Schools\nColleges\nSchools\nStudents\n\n",

Francis sent him to establish \u201cplaces\u201d for the friars in Gualdo Tadino and Viterbo. When Saint\u00a0Clare was dying, Juniper consoled her. He was devoted to the passion of Jesus and was known for his simplicity.\nSeveral stories about Juniper in the Little Flowers of St. Francis illustrate his exasperating generosity. Once Juniper was taking care of a sick man who had a craving to eat pig\u2019s feet. This helpful friar went to a nearby field, captured a pig and cut off one foot, and then served this meal to the sick man. The owner of the pig was furious and immediately went to Juniper\u2019s superior. When Juniper saw his mistake, he apologized profusely. He also ended up talking this angry man into donating the rest of the pig to the friars!\nAnother time Juniper had been commanded to quit giving part of his clothing to the half-naked people he met on the road. Desiring to obey his superior, Juniper once told a man in need that he couldn\u2019t give the man his tunic, but he wouldn\u2019t prevent the man from taking it either. In time, the friars learned not to leave anything lying around, for Juniper would probably give it away.\nHe died in 1258 and is buried at Ara Coeli Church in Rome.\nReflection\nWhat can we make of Juniper? He certainly seems to be the first of many Franciscan \u201ccharacters.\u201d No doubt some of the stories about him have improved considerably in the retelling. Although the stories about Juniper may seem a little quaint, his virtues were not. He was humble because he knew the truth about God, himself, and others. He was patient because he was willing to suffer in his following of Jesus.\n\n",

The forced period of convalescence gave her ample time for reflection. Sophia felt called to serve God by working with the poor, including street children and the elderly homeless in Warsaw\u2019s slums. In time, her cousin joined her in the work.\nIn 1855, the two women made private vows and consecrated themselves to the Blessed Mother. New followers joined them. Within two years, they formed a new congregation, which came to be known as the Felician Sisters. As their numbers grew, so did their work, and so did the pressures on Mother Angela (the new name Sophia took in religious life).\nMother Angela served as superior for many years until ill health forced her to resign at the age of 44. She watched the order grow and expand, including missions to the United States among the sons and daughters of Polish immigrants.\nPope John Paul II beatified her in 1993. Her Liturgical Feast Day is October 10.\nReflection\nLike Saints\u00a0Francis of Assisi and Ignatius of Antioch, Blessed Mary Angela experienced a conversion while convalescing from an illness.

It was a preventive system, rejecting corporal punishment and placing students in surroundings removed from the likelihood of committing sin. He advocated frequent reception of the sacraments of Penance and Holy Communion. He combined catechetical training and fatherly guidance, seeking to unite the spiritual life with one\u2019s work, study and play.\nEncouraged during his youth in Turin to become a priest so he could work with young boys, John was ordained in 1841. His service to young people started when he met a poor orphan in Turin, and instructed him in preparation for receiving Holy Communion. He then gathered young apprentices and taught them catechism.\nAfter serving as chaplain in a hospice for working girls, Don Bosco opened the Oratory of St. Francis de Sales for boys. Several wealthy and powerful patrons contributed money, enabling him to provide two workshops for the boys, shoemaking and tailoring.\nBy 1856, the institution had grown to 150 boys and had added a printing press for publication of religious and catechetical pamphlets. John\u2019s interest in vocational education and publishing justify him as patron of young apprentices and Catholic publishers.\nJohn\u2019s preaching fame spread and by 1850 he had trained his own helpers because of difficulties in retaining young priests. In 1854, he and his followers informally banded together, inspired by Saint\u00a0Francis de Sales.\nWith Pope Pius IX\u2019s encouragement, John gathered 17 men and founded the Salesians in 1859. Their activity concentrated on education and mission work. Later, he organized a group of Salesian Sisters to assist girls.\nReflection\nJohn Bosco educated the whole person\u2014body and soul united. He believed that Christ\u2019s love and our faith in that love should pervade everything we do\u2014work, study, play. For John Bosco, being a Christian was a full-time effort, not a once-a-week, Mass-on-Sunday experience. It is searching and finding God and Jesus in everything we do, letting their love lead us. Yet, because John realized the importance of job-training and the self-worth and pride that come with talent and ability, he trained his students in the trade crafts, too.\nSaint John Bosco is the Patron Saint of:\nBoys\nEditors\nYouth\n\n",

Inheriting a great deal of money from his grandfather, Charles went to Algeria with his regiment, but not without his mistress, Mimi.\nWhen he declined to give her up, he was dismissed from the army. Still in Algeria when he left Mimi, Charles reenlisted in the army. Refused permission to make a scientific exploration of nearby Morocco, he resigned from the service. With the help of a Jewish rabbi, Charles disguised himself as a Jew and in 1883, began a one-year exploration that he recorded in a book that was well received.\nInspired by the Jews and Muslims whom he met, Charles resumed the practice of his Catholic faith when he returned to France in 1886. He joined a Trappist monastery in Ardeche, France, and later transferred to one in Akbes, Syria. Leaving the monastery in 1897, Charles worked as gardener and sacristan for the Poor Clare nuns in Nazareth and later in Jerusalem. In 1901, he returned to France and was ordained a priest.\nLater that year Charles journeyed to Beni-Abbes, Morocco, intending to found a monastic religious community in North Africa that offered hospitality to Christians, Muslims, Jews, or people with no religion. He lived a peaceful, hidden life but attracted no companions.\nA former army comrade invited him to live among the Tuareg people in Algeria. Charles learned their language enough to write a Tuareg-French and French-Tuareg dictionary, and to translate the Gospels into Tuareg. In 1905, he came to Tamanrasset, where he lived the rest of his life. A two-volume collection of Charles\u2019 Tuareg poetry was published after his death.\nIn early 1909, he visited France and established an association of laypeople who pledged to live by the Gospels. His return to Tamanrasset was welcomed by the Tuareg. In 1915, Charles wrote to Louis Massignon: \u201cThe love of God, the love for one\u2019s neighbor\u2026All religion is found there\u2026How to get to that point? Not in a day since it is perfection itself: it is the goal we must always aim for, which we must unceasingly try to reach and that we will only attain in heaven.\u201d\nThe outbreak of World War I led to attacks on the French in Algeria. Seized in a raid by another tribe, Charles and two French soldiers coming to visit him were shot to death on December 1, 1916.\nFive religious congregations, associations, and spiritual institutes\u2014Little Brothers of Jesus, Little Sisters of the Sacred Heart, Little Sisters of Jesus, Little Brothers of the Gospel, and Little Sisters of the Gospel\u2014draw inspiration from the peaceful, largely hidden, yet hospitable life that characterized Charles. He was beatified on November 13, 2005.\nReflection\nThe life of Charles de Foucauld was eventually centered on God and was animated by prayer and humble service, which he hoped would draw Muslims to Christ. Those who are inspired by his example, no matter where they live, seek to live their faith humbly yet with deep religious conviction.\n",

The words were repeated to a young teacher of philosophy who had a highly promising career in academics, with success and a life of prestige and honor before him.\nFrancis Xavier, 24 at the time, and living and teaching in Paris, did not heed these words at once. They came from a good friend, Ignatius of Loyola, whose tireless persuasion finally won the young man to Christ. Francis then made the spiritual exercises under the direction of Ignatius, and in 1534, joined his little community, the infant Society of Jesus. Together at Montmartre they vowed poverty, chastity, obedience, and apostolic service according to the directions of the pope.\nFrom Venice, where he was ordained a priest in 1537, Xavier went on to Lisbon and from there sailed to the East Indies, landing at Goa, on the west coast of India. For the next 10 years he labored to bring the faith to such widely scattered peoples as the Hindus, the Malayans, and the Japanese. He spent much of that time in India, and served as provincial of the newly established Jesuit province of India.\nWherever he went, Xavier lived with the poorest people, sharing their food and rough accommodations. He spent countless hours ministering to the sick and the poor, particularly to lepers. Very often he had no time to sleep or even to say his breviary but, as we know from his letters, he was filled always with joy.\nXavier went through the islands of Malaysia, then up to Japan. He learned enough Japanese to preach to simple folk, to instruct, and to baptize, and to establish missions for those who were to follow him. From Japan he had dreams of going to China, but this plan was never realized. Before reaching the mainland, he died. His remains are enshrined in the Church of Good Jesus in Goa. He and Saint\u00a0Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux were declared co-patrons of the missions in 1925.\nReflection\nAll of us are called to \u201cgo and preach to all nations\u2014see Matthew 28:19. Our preaching is not necessarily on distant shores but to our families, our children, our husband or wife, our coworkers. And we are called to preach not with words, but by our everyday lives.

After a few years, he resigned and went to the Monastery of Saint Sabas.\nHe is famous in three areas:\nFirst, he is known for his writings against the iconoclasts, who opposed the veneration of images. Paradoxically, it was the Eastern Christian emperor Leo who forbade the practice, and it was because John lived in Muslim territory that his enemies could not silence him.\nSecond, he is famous for his treatise, Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, a summary of the Greek Fathers, of which he became the last. It is said that this book is for Eastern schools what the Summa of Aquinas became for the West.\nThird, he is known as a poet, one of the two greatest of the Eastern Church, the other being Romanus the Melodist. His devotion to the Blessed Mother and his sermons on her feasts are well known.\nReflection\nJohn defended the Church\u2019s understanding of the veneration of images and explained the faith of the Church in several other controversies. For over 30 years, he combined a life of prayer with these defenses and his other writings. His holiness expressed itself in putting his literary and preaching talents at the service of the Lord.\n",

While family members tried to persuade him to return home, the young boy felt drawn to monastic life. Although the youngest monk in the house, he excelled in virtue.\nAt age 18 he traveled to Jerusalem, seeking to learn more about living in solitude. Soon he asked to be accepted as a disciple of a well-known local solitary, though initially he was regarded as too young to live completely as a hermit. Initially, Sabas lived in a monastery, where he worked during the day and spent much of the night in prayer. At the age of 30 he was given permission to spend five days each week in a nearby remote cave, engaging in prayer and manual labor in the form of weaving baskets. Following the death of his mentor, Saint\u00a0Euthymius, Sabas moved farther into the desert near Jericho. There he lived for several years in a cave near the brook Cedron. A rope was his means of access. Wild herbs among the rocks were his food. Occasionally men brought him other food and items, while he had to go a distance for his water.\nSome of these men came to him desiring to join him in his solitude. At first he refused. But not long after relenting, his followers swelled to more than 150, all of them living in individual huts grouped around a church, called a laura.\nThe bishop persuaded a reluctant Sabas, then in his early 50s, to prepare for the priesthood so that he could better serve his monastic community in leadership. While functioning as abbot among a large community of monks, he felt ever called to live the life of a hermit. Throughout each year\u2014consistently in Lent\u2014he left his monks for long periods of time, often to their distress. A group of 60 men left the monastery, settling at a nearby ruined facility. When Sabas learned of the difficulties they were facing, he generously gave them supplies and assisted in the repair of their church.\nOver the years Sabas traveled throughout Palestine, preaching the true faith and successfully bringing back many to the Church. At the age of 91, in response to a plea from the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sabas undertook a journey to Constantinople in conjunction with the Samaritan revolt and its violent repression. He fell ill and soon after his return, died at the monastery at Mar Saba. Today the monastery is still inhabited by monks of the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Saint\u00a0Sabas is regarded as one of the most noteworthy figures of early monasticism.\nReflection\nFew of us share Sabas\u2019 yearning for a cave in the desert, but most of us sometimes resent the demands others place on our time. Sabas understands that. When at last he gained the solitude for which he yearned, a community immediately began to gather around him, and he was forced into a leadership role. He stands as a model of patient generosity for anyone whose time and energy are required by others\u2014that is, for all of us.\n",

Both the Eastern and Western Churches honor him, and it is claimed that after the Blessed Virgin, he is the saint most pictured by Christian artists. And yet historically, we can pinpoint only the fact that Nicholas was the fourth-century bishop of Myra, a city in Lycia, a province of Asia Minor.\nAs with many of the saints, however, we are able to capture the relationship which Nicholas had with God through the admiration which Christians have had for him\u2014an admiration expressed in the colorful stories which have been told and retold through the centuries.\nPerhaps the best-known story about Nicholas concerns his charity toward a poor man who was unable to provide dowries for his three daughters of marriageable age. Rather than see them forced into prostitution, Nicholas secretly tossed a bag of gold through the poor man\u2019s window on three separate occasions, thus enabling the daughters to be married. Over the centuries, this particular legend evolved into the custom of gift-giving on the saint\u2019s feast. In the English-speaking countries, Saint Nicholas became, by a twist of the tongue, Santa Claus\u2014further expanding the example of generosity portrayed by this holy bishop.\nReflection\nThe critical eye of modern history makes us take a deeper look at the legends surrounding Saint Nicholas. But perhaps we can utilize the lesson taught by his legendary charity, look deeper at our approach to material goods in the Christmas season, and seek ways to extend our sharing to those in real need.\nSaint Nicholas is the Patron Saint of:\nBakers\nBrides\nGrooms\nChildren\nGreece\nPawnbrokers\nTravelers\n\n",

He emerges as the man of action who cut a furrow through the lives of his contemporaries. Even royal personages were numbered among those who were to suffer crushing divine punishments for standing in Ambrose\u2019s way.\nWhen the Empress Justina attempted to wrest two basilicas from Ambrose\u2019s Catholics and give them to the Arians, he dared the eunuchs of the court to execute him. His own people rallied behind him in the face of imperial troops. In the midst of riots, he both spurred and calmed his people with bewitching new hymns set to exciting Eastern melodies.\nIn his disputes with the Emperor Auxentius, he coined the principle: \u201cThe emperor is in the Church, not above the Church.\u201d He publicly admonished Emperor Theodosius for the massacre of 7,000 innocent people. The emperor did public penance for his crime. This was Ambrose, the fighter sent to Milan as Roman governor, and chosen while yet a catechumen to be the people\u2019s bishop.\nThere is yet another side of Ambrose\u2014one which influenced Augustine of Hippo, whom Ambrose converted. Ambrose was a passionate little man with a high forehead, a long melancholy face, and great eyes. We can picture him as a frail figure clasping the codex of sacred Scripture. This was the Ambrose of aristocratic heritage and learning.\nAugustine found the oratory of Ambrose less soothing and entertaining but far more learned than that of other contemporaries. Ambrose\u2019s sermons were often modeled on Cicero, and his ideas betrayed the influence of contemporary thinkers and philosophers. He had no scruples in borrowing at length from pagan authors. He gloried in the pulpit in his ability to parade his spoils\u2014\u201cgold of the Egyptians\u201d\u2014taken over from the pagan philosophers.\nHis sermons, his writings, and his personal life reveal him as an otherworldly man involved in the great issues of his day. Humanity for Ambrose was, above all, spirit. In order to think rightly of God and the human soul, the closest thing to God, no material reality at all was to be dwelt upon. He was an enthusiastic champion of consecrated virginity.\nThe influence of Ambrose on Augustine will always be open for discussion. The Confessions reveal some manly, brusque encounters between Ambrose and Augustine, but there can be no doubt of Augustine\u2019s profound esteem for the learned bishop.\nNeither is there any doubt that Saint Monica loved Ambrose as an angel of God who uprooted her son from his former ways and led him to his convictions about Christ. It was Ambrose, after all, who placed his hands on the shoulders of the naked Augustine as he descended into the baptismal fountain to put on Christ.\nReflection\nAmbrose exemplifies for us the truly catholic character of Christianity. He is a man steeped in the learning, law, and culture of the ancients and of his contemporaries. Yet, in the midst of active involvement in this world, this thought runs through Ambrose\u2019s life and preaching: The hidden meaning of the Scriptures calls our spirit to rise to another world.\nSaint Ambrose is the Patron Saint of:\nBee keepers\nBeggars\nLearning\nMilan\n\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Immaculate Conception of Mary\nA feast called the Conception of Mary arose in the Eastern Church in the seventh century. It came to the West in the eighth century. In the 11th century it received its present name, the Immaculate Conception. In the 18th century it became a feast of the universal Church. It is now recognized as a solemnity.\nIn 1854, Pius IX solemnly proclaimed: \u201cThe most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instant of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the savior of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin.\u201d\nIt took a long time for this doctrine to develop. While many Fathers and Doctors of the Church considered Mary the greatest and holiest of the saints, they often had difficulty in seeing Mary as sinless\u2014either at her conception or throughout her life. This is one of the Church teachings that arose more from the piety of the faithful than from the insights of brilliant theologians. Even such champions of Mary as Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas Aquinas could not see theological justification for this teaching.\nTwo Franciscans, William of Ware and Blessed John Duns Scotus, helped develop the theology. They pointed out that Mary\u2019s Immaculate Conception enhances Jesus\u2019 redemptive work. Other members of the human race are cleansed from original sin after birth. In Mary, Jesus\u2019 work was so powerful as to prevent original sin at the outset.\nReflection\nIn Luke 1:28 the angel Gabriel, speaking on God\u2019s behalf, addresses Mary as \u201cfull of grace\u201d or \u201chighly favored\u201d. In that context, this phrase means that Mary is receiving all the special divine help necessary for the task ahead. However, the Church grows in understanding with the help of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit led the Church, especially non-theologians, to the insight that Mary had to be the most perfect work of God next to the Incarnation. Or rather, Mary\u2019s intimate association with the Incarnation called for the special involvement of God in Mary\u2019s whole life.\nThe logic of piety helped God\u2019s people to believe that Mary was full of grace and free of sin from the first moment of her existence. Moreover, this great privilege of Mary is the highlight of all that God has done in Jesus. Rightly understood, the incomparable holiness of Mary shows forth the incomparable goodness of God.\nMary as the Immaculate Conception is the Patron Saint of:\nBrazil\nUnited States\n\n",

Pope John Paul II celebrated the ceremony at which the poor Indian peasant became the Church\u2019s first saint indigenous to the Americas.\nThe Holy Father called the new saint \u201ca simple, humble Indian\u201d who accepted Christianity without giving up his identity as an Indian. \u201cIn praising the Indian Juan Diego, I want to express to all of you the closeness of the Church and the pope, embracing you with love and encouraging you to overcome with hope the difficult times you are going through,\u201d John Paul said.

The most famous part of his story is told in connection with the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe on December 12.

Twelve years later the same pope proclaimed him a saint.\nReflection\nGod counted on Juan Diego to play a humble, yet huge role in bringing the Good News to the peoples of Mexico. Overcoming his own fear and the doubts of Bishop Juan de Zumarraga, Juan Diego cooperated with God\u2019s grace in showing his people that the Good News of Jesus is for everyone. Pope John Paul II used the occasion of Juan Diego\u2019s beatification to urge Mexican lay people to assume their responsibilities for passing on the Good News and witnessing to it.\n",

Father Adolph Kolping began a ministry to them, hoping that they would not be lost to the Catholic faith, as was happening to workers elsewhere in industrialized Europe.\nBorn in the village of Kerpen, Adolph became a shoemaker at an early age because of his family\u2019s economic situation. Ordained in 1845, he ministered to young workers in Cologne, establishing a choir, which by 1849 had grown into the Young Workmen\u2019s Society. A branch of this began in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1856. Nine years later there were over 400 Gesellenvereine\u2014workman\u2019s societies\u2014around the world. Today this group has over 450,000 members in 54 countries across the globe.\nMore commonly called the Kolping Society, it emphasizes the sanctification of family life and the dignity of labor. Father Kolping worked to improve conditions for workers and greatly assisted those in need. He and St. John Bosco in Turin had similar interests in working with young men in big cities. He told his followers, \u201cThe needs of the times will teach you what to do.\u201d Father Kolping once said, \u201cThe first thing that a person finds in life and the last to which he holds out his hand, and the most precious that he possesses, even if he does not realize it, is family life.\u201d\nBlessed Adolph Kolping and Blessed John Duns Scotus are buried in Cologne\u2019s Minoritenkirche, originally served by the Conventual Franciscans.

Internal political struggles, doctrinal heresies, uneasy relations with his fellow bishops and those of the Eastern Church marred the peace of his pontificate.\nThe son of a Roman priest, possibly of Spanish extraction, Damasus started as a deacon in his father\u2019s church, and served as a priest in what later became the basilica of San Lorenzo in Rome. He served Pope Liberius (352-366) and followed him into exile.\nWhen Liberius died, Damasus was elected bishop of Rome; but a minority elected and consecrated another deacon, Ursinus, as pope. The controversy between Damasus and the antipope resulted in violent battles in two basilicas, scandalizing the bishops of Italy. At the synod that Damasus called on the occasion of his birthday, he asked them to approve his actions. The bishops\u2019 reply was curt: \u201cWe assembled for a birthday, not to condemn a man unheard.\u201d Supporters of the antipope even managed to get Damasus accused of a grave crime\u2014probably sexual\u2014as late as A.D. 378. He had to clear himself before both a civil court and a Church synod.\nAs pope, his lifestyle was simple in contrast to other ecclesiastics of Rome, and he was fierce in his denunciation of Arianism and other heresies. A misunderstanding of the Trinitarian terminology used by Rome threatened amicable relations with the Eastern Church, and Damasus was only moderately successful in dealing with that challenge.\nDuring his pontificate, Christianity was declared the official religion of the Roman state, and Latin became the principal liturgical language as part of the pope\u2019s reforms. His encouragement of Saint\u00a0Jerome\u2019s biblical studies led to the Vulgate, the Latin translation of Scripture which 12 centuries later the Council of Trent declared to be \u201cauthentic in public readings, disputations, preaching.\u201d\nReflection\nThe history of the papacy and the Church is inextricably mixed with the personal biography of Damasus. In a troubled and pivotal period of Church history, he stands forth as a zealous defender of the faith who knew when to be progressive and when to entrench.\nDamasus makes us aware of two qualities of good leadership: alertness to the promptings of the Spirit, and service. His struggles are a reminder that Jesus never promised his Rock protection from hurricane winds nor his followers immunity from difficulties. His only guarantee is final victory.\n",

Chronicles of that period tell us the story.\nA poor Indian named Cuauhtlatohuac was baptized and given the name Juan Diego. He was a 57-year-old widower, and lived in a small village near Mexico City. On Saturday morning December 9, 1531, he was on his way to a nearby barrio to attend Mass in honor of Our Lady.\nJuan was walking by a hill called Tepeyac when he heard beautiful music like the warbling of birds. A radiant cloud appeared, and within it stood an Indian maiden dressed like an Aztec princess. The lady spoke to him in his own language and sent him to the bishop of Mexico, a Franciscan named Juan de Zumarraga. The bishop was to build a chapel in the place where the lady appeared.\n\nEventually the bishop told Juan to have the lady give him a sign. About this same time Juan\u2019s uncle became seriously ill. This led poor Juan to try to avoid the lady. Nevertheless the lady found Juan, assured him that his uncle would recover, and provided roses for Juan to carry to the bishop in his cape or tilma.\nOn December 12, when Juan Diego opened his tilma in the bishop\u2019s presence, the roses fell to the ground, and the bishop sank to his knees. On the tilma where the roses had been appeared an image of Mary exactly as she had appeared at the hill of Tepeyac.\nReflection\nMary\u2019s appearance to Juan Diego as one of his people is a powerful reminder that Mary\u2014and the God who sent her\u2014accept all peoples. In the context of the sometimes rude and cruel treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards, the apparition was a rebuke to the Spaniards and an event of vast significance for the indigenous population. While a number of them had converted before this incident, they now came in droves. According to a contemporary chronicler, nine million Indians became Catholic in a very short time. In these days when we hear so much about God\u2019s preferential option for the poor, Our Lady of Guadalupe cries out to us that God\u2019s love for and identification with the poor is an age-old truth that stems from the Gospel itself.\nOur Lady of Guadalupe is the Patron Saint of:\nThe Americas\nMexico\n",

The older books will have a lengthy paragraph detailing a small number of traditions. Newer books will have a lengthy paragraph showing that there is little basis in history for these traditions. The single fact survives that a disappointed suitor accused Lucy of being a Christian, and she was executed in Syracuse, Sicily, in the year 304. But it is also true that her name is mentioned in the First Eucharistic Prayer, geographical places are named after her, a popular song has her name as its title, and down through the centuries many thousands of little girls have been proud of the name Lucy.\nOne can easily imagine what a young Christian woman had to contend with in pagan Sicily in the year 300. If you have trouble imagining, just glance at today\u2019s pleasure-at-all-costs world and the barriers it presents against leading a good Christian life.\nHer friends must have wondered aloud about this hero of Lucy\u2019s, an obscure itinerant preacher in a far-off captive nation that had been destroyed more than 200 years before. Once a carpenter, he had been crucified by the Romans after his own people turned him over to their authority. Lucy believed with her whole soul that this man had risen from the dead. Heaven had put a stamp on all he said and did. To give witness to her faith she had made a vow of virginity.\nWhat a hubbub this caused among her pagan friends! The kindlier ones just thought her a little strange. To be pure before marriage was an ancient Roman ideal, rarely found, but not to be condemned. To exclude marriage altogether, however, was too much. She must have something sinister to hide, the tongues wagged.\nLucy knew of the heroism of earlier virgin martyrs. She remained faithful to their example and to the example of the carpenter, whom she knew to be the Son of God. She is the patroness of eyesight.\nReflection\nIf you are a little girl named Lucy, you need not bite your tongue in disappointment. Your patron is a genuine authentic heroine, first class, an abiding inspiration for you and for all Christians. The moral courage of the young Sicilian martyr shines forth as a guiding light, just as bright for today\u2019s youth as it was in A.D. 304.\nSaint Lucy is the Patron Saint of:\nThe Blind\nEye Disorders\nAnother Saint of the Day for December 13 is Servant of God Berthold of Ratisbon.\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint John of the Cross\u2019 Story\nJohn is a saint because his life was a heroic effort to live up to his name: \u201cof the Cross.\u201d The folly of the cross came to full realization in time. \u201cWhoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me\u201d (Mark 8:34b) is the story of John\u2019s life. The Paschal Mystery\u2014through death to life\u2014strongly marks John as reformer, mystic-poet, and theologian-priest.\nOrdained a Carmelite priest in 1567 at age 25, John met Teresa of Avila and like her, vowed himself to the primitive Rule of the Carmelites. As partner with Teresa and in his own right, John engaged in the work of reform, and came to experience the price of reform: increasing opposition, misunderstanding, persecution, imprisonment. He came to know the cross acutely\u2014to experience the dying of Jesus\u2014as he sat month after month in his dark, damp, narrow cell with only his God.\nYet, the paradox! In this dying of imprisonment John came to life, uttering poetry. In the darkness of the dungeon, John\u2019s spirit came into the Light. There are many mystics, many poets; John is unique as mystic-poet, expressing in his prison-cross the ecstasy of mystical union with God in the Spiritual Canticle.\nBut as agony leads to ecstasy, so John had his Ascent to Mt. Carmel, as he named it in his prose masterpiece. As man-Christian-Carmelite, he experienced in himself this purifying ascent; as spiritual director, he sensed it in others; as psychologist-theologian, he described and analyzed it in his prose writings. His prose works are outstanding in underscoring the cost of discipleship, the path of union with God: rigorous discipline, abandonment, purification. Uniquely and strongly John underlines the gospel paradox: The cross leads to resurrection, agony to ecstasy, darkness to light, abandonment to possession, denial to self to union with God. If you want to save your life, you must lose it. John is truly \u201cof the Cross.\u201d He died at 49\u2014a life short, but full.\nReflection\nIn his life and writings, John of the Cross has a crucial word for us today. We tend to be rich, soft, comfortable. We shrink even from words like self-denial, mortification, purification, asceticism, discipline. We run from the cross. John\u2019s message\u2014like the gospel\u2014is loud and clear: Don\u2019t\u2014if you really want to live!\nSaint John of the Cross is the Patron Saint of:\nMystics\n",

By the age of 16 his father had died. He studied architecture at the School of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Suspected of participating in a rebellious conspiracy against the Czarists in Poland, he was imprisoned from April 1846 until March of 1847. His life then took a turn for the better, and in 1848 he received the Capuchin habit and a new name, Honoratus. He was ordained in 1855 and dedicated his energies to the ministry where he was involved, among other things, with the Secular Franciscan Order.\nA 1864 revolt against Czar Alexander III failed, which led to the suppression of all religious orders in Poland. The Capuchins were expelled from Warsaw and moved to Zakroczym. There Honoratus founded 26 religious congregations. These men and women took vows but did not wear a religious habit and did not live in community. In many regards, they lived as members of today\u2019s secular institutes do. Seventeen of these groups still exist as religious congregations.\nFather Honoratus\u2019 writings include many volumes of sermons, letters, and works on ascetical theology, works on Marian devotion, historical and pastoral writings, as well as many writings for the religious congregations which he founded.\nWhen various bishops sought to reorganize the communities under their authority in 1906, Honoratus defended them and their independence. In 1908, he was relieved of his leadership role. Nevertheless he encouraged the members of these communities to be obedient to the Church.\nFather Honoratus died on December 16, 1916, and was beatified in 1988.\nReflection\nFather Honoratus realized that the religious communities that he founded were not truly his. When ordered by Church officials to relinquish control, he instructed the communities to be obedient to the Church. He could have become bitter or combative, but instead he accepted his fate with religious submission, and realized that the gifts of the Religious were to be gifts to the larger community. He learned to let go.\n",

When Hildegard was 18, she became a Benedictine nun at the Monastery of Saint\u00a0Disibodenberg. Ordered by her confessor to write down the visions that she had received since the age of three, Hildegard took ten years to write her Scivias (Know the Ways). Pope Eugene III read it, and in 1147, encouraged her to continue writing. Her Book of the Merits of Life and Book of Divine Works followed. She wrote over 300 letters to people who sought her advice; she also composed short works on medicine and physiology, and sought advice from contemporaries such as Saint\u00a0Bernard of Clairvaux.\nHildegard\u2019s visions caused her to see humans as \u201cliving sparks\u201d of God\u2019s love, coming from God as daylight comes from the sun. Sin destroyed the original harmony of creation; Christ\u2019s redeeming death and resurrection opened up new possibilities. Virtuous living reduces the estrangement from God and others that sin causes.\nLike all mystics, Hildegard saw the harmony of God\u2019s creation and the place of women and men in that. This unity was not apparent to many of her contemporaries.\nHildegard was no stranger to controversy. The monks near her original foundation protested vigorously when she moved her monastery to Bingen, overlooking the Rhine River. She confronted Emperor Frederick Barbarossa for supporting at least three antipopes. Hildegard challenged the Cathars, who rejected the Catholic Church claiming to follow a more pure Christianity.\nBetween 1152 and 1162, Hildegard often preached in the Rhineland. Her monastery was placed under interdict because she had permitted the burial of a young man who had been excommunicated. She insisted that he had been reconciled with the Church and had received its sacraments before dying. Hildegard protested bitterly when the local bishop forbade the celebration of or reception of the Eucharist at the Bingen monastery, a sanction that was lifted only a few months before her death.\nIn 2012, Hildegard was canonized and named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Benedict XVI.\u00a0Her Liturgical Feast Day is September 17.\nReflection\nPope Benedict spoke about Hildegard of Bingen during two of his general audiences in September 2010. He praised the humility with which she received God\u2019s gifts, and the obedience she gave Church authorities. He praised too the \u201crich theological content\u201d of her mystical visions that sum up the history of salvation from creation to the end of time.\nDuring his papacy, Pope Benedict XVI said, \u201cLet us always invoke the Holy Spirit, so that he may inspire in the Church holy and courageous women like Saint\u00a0Hildegard of Bingen who, developing the gifts they have received from God, make their own special and valuable contribution to the spiritual development of our communities and of the Church in our time.\u201d\n",

As a schoolboy, he frequented the local church of the Oratorian Fathers, joining the religious order when he was 17.\nAlready a fine student, Anthony soon gained a reputation in his religious community as a \u201cwalking dictionary,\u201d who quickly grasped Scripture and theology. For some time he was tormented by scruples, but they reportedly left him at the very hour he celebrated his first Mass. From that day, serenity penetrated his very being.\nIn 1621, at age 29, Anthony was struck by lightning while praying in the church of the Holy House at Loreto. He was carried paralyzed from the church, expecting to die. When Anthony\u00a0recovered in a few days he realized that he had been cured of acute indigestion. His scorched clothes were donated to the Loreto church as an offering of thanks for his new gift of life.\nMore importantly, Anthony now felt that his life belonged entirely to God. Each year thereafter he made a pilgrimage to Loreto to express his thanks.\nHe also began hearing confessions, and came to be regarded as an outstanding confessor. Simple and direct, Anthony listened carefully to penitents, said a few words, and gave a penance and absolution, frequently drawing on his gift of reading consciences.\nIn 1635, Anthony was elected superior of the Fermo Oratory. He was so well regarded that he was reelected every three years until his death. He was a quiet person and a gentle superior who did not know how to be severe. At the same time he kept the Oratorian constitutions literally, encouraging the community to do likewise.\nHe refused social or civic commitments and instead would go out day or night to visit the sick or dying or anyone else needing his services. As Anthony grew older, he had a God-given awareness of the future, a gift which he frequently used to warn or to console.\nBut age brought its challenges as well. Anthony suffered the humility of having to give up his physical faculties one by one. First was his preaching, necessitated after he lost his teeth. Then he could no longer hear confessions. Finally after a fall, Anthony was confined to his room. The archbishop himself came each day to give him Holy Communion. One of his final acts was to reconcile two fiercely quarreling brothers.\u00a0The Liturgical Feast of Blessed Anthony Grassi is December 15.\nReflection\nNothing provides a better reason for reassessing a life than a brush with death. Anthony\u2019s life already seemed to be on track when he was struck by lightning; he was a brilliant priest, blessed at last with serenity. But the experience softened him. Anthony became a loving counselor and a wise mediator. The same might be said of us if we put our hearts to it. We needn\u2019t wait to be struck by lightning.\n",

A Benedictine monk and canon lawyer, he was deeply spiritual and brilliant. He lived simply and modestly, which did not always earn him friends among clergymen who had become used to comfort and privilege. Still, he pressed for reform, and saw to the restoration of churches and monasteries.

As a young boy he spent time in the fields, where he welcomed the solitude. He became a Benedictine priest and served in numerous leadership positions.

Under Dominic\u2019s leadership, however, it became one of the most famous houses in Spain. Many healings were reported there.\nAbout 100 years after Dominic\u2019s death, a young woman who experienced difficult pregnancies made a pilgrimage to his tomb.

Peter lived his 76 years at a pace which must be considered heroic, even in our time of rapid change. A man blessed with many talents, Peter is an excellent example of the scriptural man who develops his talents for the sake of the Lord\u2019s work.\nPeter was one of the most important figures in the Catholic Reformation in Germany. He played\u00a0such a key role that he has often been called the \u201csecond apostle of Germany,\u201d in that his life parallels the earlier work of Boniface.\nAlthough Peter once accused himself of idleness in his youth, he could not have been idle too long, for at the age of 19 he received a master\u2019s degree from the university at Cologne. Soon afterwards he met Peter Faber, the first disciple of Ignatius of Loyola, who influenced Peter so much that he joined the recently formed Society of Jesus.\nAt this early age Peter had already taken up a practice he continued throughout his life\u2014a process of study, reflection, prayer, and writing. After his ordination in 1546, he became widely known for his editions of the writings of Saint\u00a0Cyril of Alexandria and St. Leo the Great. Besides this reflective literary bent, Peter had a zeal for the apostolate. He could often be found visiting the sick or imprisoned, even when his assigned duties in other areas were more than enough to keep most people fully occupied.\nIn 1547, Peter attended several sessions of the Council of Trent, whose decrees he was later assigned to implement. After a brief teaching assignment at the Jesuit college at Messina, Peter was entrusted with the mission to Germany\u2014from that point on his life\u2019s work. He taught in several universities and was instrumental in establishing many colleges and seminaries. He wrote a catechism that explained the Catholic faith in a way that common people could understand\u2014a great need of that age.\nRenowned as a popular preacher, Peter packed churches with those eager to hear his eloquent proclamation of the gospel. He had great diplomatic ability, often serving as a reconciler between disputing factions. In his letters\u2014filling eight volumes\u2014one finds words of wisdom and counsel to people in all walks of life. At times he wrote unprecedented letters of criticism to leaders of the Church\u2014yet always in the context of a loving, sympathetic concern.\nAt 70, Peter suffered a paralytic seizure, but he continued to preach and write with the aid of a secretary, until his death in his hometown of Nijmegen, Netherlands, on December 21, 1597.\nReflection\nPeter\u2019s untiring efforts are an apt example for those involved in the renewal of the Church or the growth of moral consciousness in business or government. He is regarded as one of the creators of the Catholic press, and can easily be a model for the Christian author or journalist. Teachers can see in his life a passion for the transmission of truth. Whether we have much to give, as Peter Canisius did, or whether we have only a little to give, as did the poor widow in the\u00a0Gospel of Luke (see Luke 21:1\u20134), the important thing is to give our all. It is in this way that Peter is so exemplary for Christians in an age of rapid change when we are called to be in the world but not of the world.\nSaint Peter Canisius is the Patron Saint of:\nGermany\n",

He became a successful lawyer and married a pious, generous lady named Vanna.\nHis young wife took it upon herself to do penance for the worldly excesses of her husband. One day Vanna, at the insistence of Jacomo, attended a public tournament. She was sitting in the stands with the other noble ladies when the stands collapsed. Vanna was killed. Her shaken husband was even more disturbed when he realized that the penitential girdle she wore was for his sinfulness. On the spot, he vowed to radically change his life.\nJacomo divided his possessions among the poor and entered the Secular Franciscan Order. Often dressed in penitential rags, he was mocked as a fool and called Jacopone, or \u201cCrazy Jim,\u201d by his former associates. The name became dear to him.\nAfter 10 years of such humiliation, Jacopone asked to be received into the Order of Friars Minor. Because of his reputation, his request was initially refused. He composed a beautiful poem on the vanities of the world, an act that eventually led to his admission into the Order in 1278. He continued to lead a life of strict penance, declining to be ordained a priest. Meanwhile, he was writing popular hymns in the vernacular.\nJacopone suddenly found himself a leader in a disturbing religious movement among the Franciscans. The Spirituals, as they were called, wanted a return to the strict poverty of Francis. They had on their side two cardinals of the Church and Pope Celestine V. These two cardinals though, opposed Celestine\u2019s successor, Boniface VIII. At the age of 68, Jacopone was excommunicated and imprisoned. Although he acknowledged his mistake, Jacopone was not absolved and released until Benedict XI became pope five years later. He had accepted his imprisonment as penance. He spent the final three years of his life more spiritual than ever, weeping \u201cbecause Love is not loved.\u201d During this time he wrote the famous Latin hymn, Stabat Mater.\nOn Christmas Eve in 1306 Jacopone felt that his end was near. He was in a convent of the Poor Clares with his friend, Blessed John of La Verna. Like Francis, Jacopone welcomed \u201cSister Death\u201d with one of his favorite songs. It is said that he finished the song and died as the priest intoned the \u201cGloria\u201d from the midnight Mass at Christmas. From the time of his death, Brother Jacopone has been venerated as a saint.\nReflection\nHis contemporaries called Jacopone, \u201cCrazy Jim.\u201d We might well echo their taunt, for what else can you say about a man who broke into song in the midst of all his troubles? We still sing Jacopone\u2019s saddest song, the Stabat Mater, but we Christians claim another song as our own, even when the daily headlines resound with discordant notes. Jacopone\u2019s whole life rang out our song: \u201cAlleluia!\u201d May he inspire us to keep singing.\n",

The inevitable opposition which saints encounter led to his being ousted by rivals and sent to be a parish priest at Olkusz.

But in the end he won his people\u2019s hearts. After some time he returned to Krak\u00f3w and taught Scripture for the remainder of his life.\nJohn was a serious man, and humble, but known to all the poor of Krak\u00f3w for his kindness. His goods and his money were always at their disposal, and time and again they took advantage of him. He kept only the money and clothes absolutely needed to support himself. He slept little, ate sparingly, and took no meat. He made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, hoping to be martyred by the Turks. Later John made four subsequent pilgrimages to Rome, carrying his luggage on his back. When he was warned to look after his health, he was quick to point out that, for all their austerity, the fathers of the desert lived remarkably long lives.\nReflection\nJohn of Kanty is a typical saint: He was kind, humble, and generous, he suffered opposition and led an austere, penitential life. Most Christians in an affluent society can understand all the ingredients except the last: Anything more than mild self-discipline seems reserved for athletes and ballet dancers.

Word went out to the people of the town. At the appointed time, they arrived carrying torches and candles.\nOne of the friars began celebrating Mass. Francis himself gave the sermon. His biographer, Thomas of Celano, recalls that Francis \u201cstood before the manger\u2026overcome with love and filled with a wonderful happiness\u2026\u201d\nFor Francis, the simple celebration was meant to recall the hardships Jesus suffered even as an infant, a savior who chose to become poor for our sake, a truly human Jesus.\nTonight, as we pray around the Christmas cribs in our homes, we welcome into our hearts that same Savior.\nReflection\nGod\u2019s choice to give human beings free will was from the beginning a decision to be helpless in human hands. With the birth of Jesus, God made the divine helplessness very clear to us, for a human infant is totally dependent on the loving response of other people. Our natural response to a baby is to open our arms as Francis did\u2013to the infant of Bethlehem, and to the God who made us all.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nThe Story of the Nativity of the Lord\nOn this day, the Church focuses especially on the newborn Child, God become human, who embodies for us all the hope and peace we seek. We need no other special saint today to lead us to Christ in the manger, although his mother Mary and Joseph, caring for his foster-son, help round out the scene.\nBut if we were to select a patron for today, perhaps it might be appropriate for us to imagine an anonymous shepherd, summoned to the birthplace by a wondrous and even disturbing vision in the night, a summons from an angelic choir, promising peace and goodwill. A shepherd willing to seek out something that might just be too unbelievable to chase after, and yet compelling enough to leave behind the flocks in the field and search for a mystery.\nOn the day of the Lord\u2019s birth, let\u2019s let an unnamed, \u201cnon-celebrity\u201d at the edge of the crowd model for us the way to discover Christ in our own hearts\u2014somewhere between skepticism and wonder, between mystery and faith. And like Mary and the shepherds, let\u2019s treasure that discovery in our hearts.\nReflection\nThe precise dating in the Scripture readings for today sounds like a textbook on creationism. If we focus on the time frame, however, we miss the point. It lays out the story of a love affair: creation, the deliverance of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt, the rise of Israel under David. It climaxes with the birth of Jesus. Some scholars insist that from the beginning God intended to enter the world as one of us, the beloved people. Praise God!\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint Stephen\u2019s Story\n\u201cAs the number of disciples continued to grow, the Greek-speaking Christians complained against the Hebrew-speaking Christians, saying that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. So the Twelve called together the community of the disciples and said, \u2018It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve at table. Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task, whereas we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.\u2019 The proposal was acceptable to the whole community, so they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit\u2026\u201d (Acts 6:1-5).\nActs of the Apostles says that Stephen was a man filled with grace and power, who worked great wonders among the people. Certain Jews, members of the Synagogue of Roman Freedmen, debated with Stephen, but proved no match for the wisdom and spirit with which he spoke. They persuaded others to make the charge of blasphemy against him. He was seized and carried before the Sanhedrin.\nIn his speech, Stephen recalled God\u2019s guidance through Israel\u2019s history, as well as Israel\u2019s idolatry and disobedience. He then claimed that his persecutors were showing this same spirit. \u201c\u2026you always oppose the holy Spirit; you are just like your ancestors\u201d (Acts 7:51b).\nStephen\u2019s speech brought anger from the crowd. \u201cBut he, filled with the holy Spirit, looked up intently to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and he said, \u2018Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\u2019 \u2026They threw him out of the city, and began to stone him. \u2026As they were stoning Stephen, he called out, \u2018Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\u2019 \u2026\u2018Lord, do not hold this sin against them\u2019\u201d (Acts 7:55-56, 58a, 59, 60b).\nReflection\nStephen died as Jesus did: falsely accused, brought to unjust condemnation because he spoke the truth fearlessly. He died with his eyes trustfully fixed on God, and with a prayer of forgiveness on his lips. A \u201chappy\u201d death is one that finds us in the same spirit, whether our dying is as quiet as Joseph\u2019s or as violent as Stephen\u2019s: dying with courage, total trust and forgiving love.\nSaint Stephen is the Patron Saint of:\nDeacons\n",

        "about": "\u00a0\nSaint John the Apostle\u2019s Story\nIt is God who calls; human beings answer. The vocation of John and his brother James is stated very simply in the Gospels, along with that of Peter and his brother Andrew: Jesus called them; they followed. The absoluteness of their response is indicated by the account. James and John \u201cwere in a boat, with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them, and immediately they left their boat and their father and followed him\u201d (Matthew 4:21b-22).\nFor the three former fishermen\u2014Peter, James and John\u2014that faith was to be rewarded by a special friendship with Jesus. They alone were privileged to be present at the Transfiguration, the raising of the daughter of Jairus and the agony in Gethsemane. But John\u2019s friendship was even more special. Tradition assigns to him the Fourth Gospel, although most modern Scripture scholars think it unlikely that the apostle and the evangelist are the same person.\nJohn\u2019s own Gospel refers to him as \u201cthe disciple whom Jesus loved\u201d (see John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2), the one who reclined next to Jesus at the Last Supper, and the one to whom Jesus gave the exquisite honor of caring for his mother, as John stood beneath the cross. \u201cWoman, behold your son\u2026. Behold, your mother\u201d (John 19:26b, 27b).\nBecause of the depth of his Gospel, John is usually thought of as the eagle of theology, soaring in high regions that other writers did not enter. But the ever-frank Gospels reveal some very human traits. Jesus gave James and John the nickname, \u201csons of thunder.\u201d While it is difficult to know exactly what this meant, a clue is given in two incidents.\nIn the first, as Matthew tells it, their mother asked that they might sit in the places of honor in Jesus\u2019 kingdom\u2014one on his right hand, one on his left. When Jesus asked them if they could drink the cup he would drink and be baptized with his baptism of pain, they blithely answered, \u201cWe can!\u201d Jesus said that they would indeed share his cup, but that sitting at his right hand was not his to give. It was for those to whom it had been reserved by the Father. The other apostles were indignant at the mistaken ambition of the brothers, and Jesus took the occasion to teach them the true nature of authority: \u201c\u2026[W]hoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave. Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many\u201d (Matthew 20:27-28).\nOn another occasion, the \u201csons of thunder\u201d asked Jesus if they should not call down fire from heaven upon the inhospitable Samaritans, who would not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to Jerusalem. But Jesus \u201cturned and rebuked them\u201d (see Luke 9:51-55).\nOn the first Easter, Mary Magdalene \u201cran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, \u2018They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don\u2019t know where they put him\u2019\u201d (John 20:2). John recalls, perhaps with a smile, that he and Peter ran side by side, but then \u201cthe other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first\u201d (John 20:4b). He did not enter, but waited for Peter and let him go in first. \u201cThen the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed\u201d (John 20:8).\nJohn was with Peter when the first great miracle after the Resurrection took place\u2014the cure of the man crippled from birth\u2014which led to their spending the night in jail together. The mysterious experience of the Resurrection is perhaps best contained in the words of Acts: \u201cObserving the boldness of Peter and John and perceiving them to be uneducated, ordinary men, they [the questioners] were amazed, and they recognized them as the companions of Jesus\u201d (Acts 4:13).\nThe Apostle John is traditionally considered the author also of three New Testament letters and the Book of Revelation. His Gospel is a very personal account. He sees the glorious and divine Jesus already in the incidents of his mortal life. At the Last Supper, John\u2019s Jesus speaks as if he were already in heaven. John\u2019s is the Gospel of Jesus\u2019 glory.\nReflection\nIt is a long way from being eager to sit on a throne of power or to call down fire from heaven to becoming the man who could write: \u201cThe way we came to know love was that he laid down his life for us; so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers\u201d (1 John 3:16).\nSaint John the Apostle is the Patron Saint of:\nTurkey\n",

Hence he was insecure and fearful of any threat to his throne. He was a master politician and a tyrant capable of extreme brutality. He killed his wife, his brother, and his sister\u2019s two husbands, to name only a few.\nMatthew 2:1-18 tells this story: Herod was \u201cgreatly troubled\u201d when astrologers from the east came asking the whereabouts of \u201cthe newborn king of the Jews,\u201d whose star they had seen. They were told that the Jewish Scriptures named Bethlehem as the place where the Messiah would be born. Herod cunningly told them to report back to him so that he could also \u201cdo him homage.\u201d They found Jesus, offered him their gifts, and warned by an angel, avoided Herod on their way home. Jesus escaped to Egypt.\nHerod became furious and \u201cordered the massacre of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity two\u00a0years old and under.\u201d The horror of the massacre and the devastation of the mothers and fathers led Matthew to quote Jeremiah: \u201cA voice was heard in Ramah, sobbing and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children\u2026\u201d (Matthew 2:18). Rachel was the wife of Jacob (Israel). She is pictured as weeping at the place where the Israelites were herded together by the conquering Assyrians for their march into captivity.\nReflection\nThe Holy Innocents are few in comparison to the genocide and abortion of our day. But even if there had been only one, we recognize the greatest treasure God put on the earth\u2014a human person, destined for eternity, and graced by Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection.\nThe Holy Innocents are the Patron Saints of:\nBabies\n",

While archdeacon of Canterbury, he was made chancellor of England at the age of 36 by his friend King Henry II. When Henry felt it advantageous to make his chancellor the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas gave him fair warning: he might not accept all of Henry\u2019s intrusions into Church affairs. Nevertheless, in 1162 he was made archbishop, resigned his chancellorship, and reformed his whole way of life!\nTroubles began. Henry insisted upon usurping Church rights. At one time, supposing some conciliatory action possible, Thomas came close to compromise. He momentarily approved the Constitutions of Clarendon, which would have denied the clergy the right of trial by a Church court and prevented them from making direct appeal to Rome. But Thomas rejected the Constitutions, fled to France for safety, and remained in exile for seven years. When he returned to England he suspected it would mean certain death. Because Thomas refused to remit censures he had placed upon bishops favored by the king, Henry cried out in a rage, \u201cWill no one rid me of this troublesome priest!\u201d Four knights, taking his words as his wish, slew Thomas in the Canterbury cathedral.\nThomas Becket remains a hero-saint down to our own times.\nReflection\nNo one becomes a saint without struggle, especially with himself. Thomas knew he must stand firm in defense of truth and right, even at the cost of his life. We also must take a stand in the face of pressures\u2014against dishonesty, deceit, destruction of life\u2014at the cost of popularity, convenience, promotion, and even greater goods.\nSaint Thomas Becket is the Patron Saint of:\nRoman Catholic Secular Clergy\n",

Chances are you aren\u2019t\u2014unless you\u2019re especially informed about Benedictine bishops who established monasteries in medieval England.\nBorn in the seventh century of royal blood, Egwin entered a monastery, and was enthusiastically received by royalty, clergy, and the people as the bishop of Worcester, England. As a bishop he was known as a protector of orphans and the widowed and a fair judge. Who could argue with that?\nHis popularity didn\u2019t hold up among members of the clergy, however. They saw him as overly strict, while he felt he was simply trying to correct abuses and impose appropriate disciplines. Bitter resentments arose, and Egwin made his way to Rome to present his case to Pope Constantine. The case against Egwin was examined and annulled.\nUpon his return to England, Egwin founded Evesham Abbey, which became one of the great Benedictine houses of medieval England. It was dedicated to Mary, who had reportedly made it known to Egwin just where a church should be built in her honor.\nEgwin died at the abbey on December 30, 717. Following his burial many miracles were attributed to him: The blind could see, the deaf could hear, the sick were healed.\nReflection\nCorrecting abuses and faults is never an easy job, not even for a bishop. Egwin attempted to correct and build up the clergy in his diocese and it earned him the wrath of his priests.\u00a0When we are called to correct someone or some group, plan on opposition, but also know that it might be the right thing to do.\n",

But for the most part, these events were planned or brought about by Emperor Constantine.\nA great store of legends has grown up around the man who was pope at this most important time, but very little can be established historically. We know for sure that his papacy lasted from 314 until his death in 335. Reading between the lines of history, we are assured that only a very strong and wise man could have preserved the essential independence of the Church in the face of the overpowering figure of the Emperor Constantine. In general, the bishops remained loyal to the Holy See, and at times expressed apologies to Sylvester for undertaking important ecclesiastical projects at the urging of Constantine.\nReflection\nIt takes deep humility and courage in the face of criticism for a leader to stand aside and let events take their course, when asserting one\u2019s authority would only lead to useless tension and strife.
